Review Team\nServices\nOur\nIPS\nPlan\nPart 2 of the\nFreedom of Information Act 1982\n(\nFOI\nAct) establishes an\nInformation\nPublication Scheme\n(\nIPS\n) for Australian Government agencies subject to the\nFOI\nAct.\nThe IPS commenced on 1 May 2011 and requires the Department of Defence to\npublish a broad range of information on this website. Defence is also required\nto publish a plan that explains how the IPS is administered.\nThe\nIPS\nunderpins a pro-disclosure culture across government, and transforms\nthe freedom of information framework from one that is reactive to individual\nrequests for documents, to one that also relies more heavily on agency driven\npublication of information. The\nIPS\nrequirements are intended to facilitate and\npromote public access to information promptly and at the lowest reasonable cost.\nThis plan describes how Defence implements and administers its IPS entries as required by s 8(1) of the\nFOI\nAct, by addressing:\nadministration of the Defence\nIPS\nentries;\ninformation architecture;\ninformation required to be published;\nother information to be published; and\nIPS\ncompliance review.\nDefence will continue to build and foster a culture in which appropriate proactive disclosure of its information holdings is embraced. This is in recognition that public sector information is a national resource, managed for public purposes.\nPurpose\nThe purpose of this agency plan is to:\nassist Defence in maintaining and enhancing its\nIPS\nentries;\nfacilitate improved transparency about that entries; and\nfurther identify information for public release, as well as ways in which Defence can improve compliance with the\nIPS\nrequirements.\nObjectives\nDefence's objective is to outline appropriate mechanisms and procedures to:\nmanage its\nIPS\nentries;\nidentify and publish all information required to be published\n(s 8(2))\n;\nproactively identify and publish any other information to be published (s 8(4));\nreview on a regular basis and ensure that information published as part of its\nIPS\nentries is accurate, up to date and complete (s 8B);\nensure that information published as part of its\nIPS\nentries is easily discoverable, understandable, machine-readable, re-useable and transformable;\nensure satisfactory conformance with\nWeb Content Accessibility Guidelines (Version 2) (WCAG 2.0)\n;\nmeasure the success of the Defence\nIPS\nentries by reference to community feedback and compliance review processes; and\nreduce the number of formal requests under the\nFOI\nAct by making information that is\nroutinely sought\nreadily available and accessible.\nInformation required to be published under the\nIPS\nDefence has published mandatory information required under the\nIPS\n(s 8(2))\nas part of the top level information architecture and\nabout us\ninformation on the Defence website.\nThis includes:\na plan for the Information Publication Scheme (this plan);\nan\norganisation chart\nsetting out the structure of the organisation;\ndetails of our\nfunctions\n, including\ndecision-making powers\nand other powers affecting members of the public;\ndetails of\nappointments\nof officers made under Acts - such as appointments of\nstatutory officers\n;\nour\nannual reports\n;\ndetails of\nconsultation arrangements\nfor members of the public to comment on specific policy proposals for which Defence is responsible, including how (and to whom) those comments may be made;\ninformation which\nDefence routinely releases\nin response to\nFOI\nrequests\n;\ninformation that\nDefence routinely provides to the Parliament\nin response to requests and orders from the Parliament;\nhow we can be contacted about\naccess to information\nor\ndocuments under the\nFOI\nAct;\nand\nour\noperational information\n, insofar as it extends to our exercising functions and powers in making decisions or recommendations which may affect members of the public.\nOther information to be published under the\nIPS\nDefence proactively publishes other information that it holds (in addition to the information published under s 8(2)), taking into account the objects of the\nFOI\nAct (s 8(4)).\nIn keeping with improved accountability within Defence, from 20 January 2012,\nHot Issue Briefs\nsubmitted to the\nMinister for Defence by the Department of Defence\nare publicly released under the\nIPS\n.\nAdministering our\nIPS\nentry\nGovernance arrangements\nThe Assistant Secretary, Information, Management and Access (IMA) is the strategic manager of\nFOI\nprocesses, the\nIPS\n, and corporate information management more generally. The IMA Branch administers the Defence\nIPS\nentries and is responsible for implementing, reviewing and revising this plan.\nThe governance arrangements established to support information management improvements in Defence include an Information Management Steering Committee. With membership at 3 Star/Senior Executive Service Band 3 level from each Group and Service, the Committee sets the whole-of Defence direction for corporate information management. The committee is co-chaired by the\nDeputy Secretary\n,\nDefence Support and Reform Group\nand the\nChief Information Officer\n.\nInformation asset framework\nPublishing and managing the Defence\nIPS\nentries is undertaken in accordance with the existing Defence publishing framework, which consists of a set of processes underpinned by corporate strategies, policies and standards.\nIn 2014, the Defence Web Estate Manual was released and it provides governance and guidance for the preparation, authorisation and publishing of web content. Defence will continue to update its\nRecords Management Policy\nto address changes in the\nArchives Act 1983\nand Records in Evidence obligations, as well as the introduction of the\nGovernment's Digital Transition Policy\n.\nThe\nInformation Management Strategic Framework (IMSF)\nwhich was endorsed by the Defence Committee in 2010, brings together a set of principles and objectives that underpin a whole-of-Defence approach to Information Management.\nAccess\nIn keeping with the requirements of the whole-of-government\nWeb Accessibility National Transition Strategy\n, Defence has established a web team to improve web services and access to Defence information. The team is responsible for monitoring Defence's vast web environment and ensuring that the Defence websites comply with the Australian Government Information Management Office's web accessibility rating.\nRegister of information\nDefence maintains an internal register of information required or permitted to be published under the\nIPS\n. The register contains details on:\nthe business area and contact officer responsible for the information;\nwhen the information was last updated;\nwhen the information is next scheduled for review; and\nif a document is not published online, who the contact officer is to obtain a copy.\nCurrency\nDefence ensures its\nIPS\nentries are accurate, up to date and complete by undertaking the following:\nadhering to the internal\nIPS\nstandard operating procedures which set out roles and responsibilities, procedures to manage the\nIPS\ncontent, and a notification and review process for adding new content and reviewing existing content for currency and relevancy;\nadhering to section 11C of the\nFOI\nAct by publishing decisions and documents released under\nFOI\ntaking into consideration the Guidelines issued by the Australian Information Commissioner; and\ninviting public feedback on the\nIPS\n.\nCharges\nDefence will not charge for information provided by email. However, where information is requested in an alternative format (for example, a photocopy of the document) and the reimbursement or incidental costs would be more than $100, charges may apply. The charges that may apply are listed below.\nA list of charges\nFormat\nCharges\nPhotocopy\n10 cents per page\nCopy (other than photocopy)\n$4.40 per page\nCopy of the document in the form of a computer disk\nAn amount not exceeding the actual costs incurred by Defence in producing the copy\nCopy of the document to be sent to the applicant by post or delivered to the applicant\nAn amount not exceeding the cost of postage or delivery\nGenerally there will be no charge where the cost would be below $100.\nInformation architecture\nThe point of entry for public access to the Defence\nIPS\ncontent is the\nDefence website homepage\n.

Review Team\nServices\nOur\nIPS\nPlan\nPart 2 of the\nFreedom of Information Act 1982\n(\nFOI\nAct) establishes an\nInformation\nPublication Scheme\n(\nIPS\n) for Australian Government agencies subject to the\nFOI\nAct.\nThe IPS commenced on 1 May 2011 and requires the Department of Defence to\npublish a broad range of information on this website. Defence is also required\nto publish a plan that explains how the IPS is administered.\nThe\nIPS\nunderpins a pro-disclosure culture across government, and transforms\nthe freedom of information framework from one that is reactive to individual\nrequests for documents, to one that also relies more heavily on agency driven\npublication of information. The\nIPS\nrequirements are intended to facilitate and\npromote public access to information promptly and at the lowest reasonable cost.\nThis plan describes how Defence implements and administers its IPS entries as required by s 8(1) of the\nFOI\nAct, by addressing:\nadministration of the Defence\nIPS\nentries;\ninformation architecture;\ninformation required to be published;\nother information to be published; and\nIPS\ncompliance review.\nDefence will continue to build and foster a culture in which appropriate proactive disclosure of its information holdings is embraced. This is in recognition that public sector information is a national resource, managed for public purposes.\nPurpose\nThe purpose of this agency plan is to:\nassist Defence in maintaining and enhancing its\nIPS\nentries;\nfacilitate improved transparency about that entries; and\nfurther identify information for public release, as well as ways in which Defence can improve compliance with the\nIPS\nrequirements.\nObjectives\nDefence's objective is to outline appropriate mechanisms and procedures to:\nmanage its\nIPS\nentries;\nidentify and publish all information required to be published\n(s 8(2))\n;\nproactively identify and publish any other information to be published (s 8(4));\nreview on a regular basis and ensure that information published as part of its\nIPS\nentries is accurate, up to date and complete (s 8B);\nensure that information published as part of its\nIPS\nentries is easily discoverable, understandable, machine-readable, re-useable and transformable;\nensure satisfactory conformance with\nWeb Content Accessibility Guidelines (Version 2) (WCAG 2.0)\n;\nmeasure the success of the Defence\nIPS\nentries by reference to community feedback and compliance review processes; and\nreduce the number of formal requests under the\nFOI\nAct by making information that is\nroutinely sought\nreadily available and accessible.\nInformation required to be published under the\nIPS\nDefence has published mandatory information required under the\nIPS\n(s 8(2))\nas part of the top level information architecture and\nabout us\ninformation on the Defence website.\nThis includes:\na plan for the Information Publication Scheme (this plan);\nan\norganisation chart\nsetting out the structure of the organisation;\ndetails of our\nfunctions\n, including\ndecision-making powers\nand other powers affecting members of the public;\ndetails of\nappointments\nof officers made under Acts - such as appointments of\nstatutory officers\n;\nour\nannual reports\n;\ndetails of\nconsultation arrangements\nfor members of the public to comment on specific policy proposals for which Defence is responsible, including how (and to whom) those comments may be made;\ninformation which\nDefence routinely releases\nin response to\nFOI\nrequests\n;\ninformation that\nDefence routinely provides to the Parliament\nin response to requests and orders from the Parliament;\nhow we can be contacted about\naccess to information\nor\ndocuments under the\nFOI\nAct;\nand\nour\noperational information\n, insofar as it extends to our exercising functions and powers in making decisions or recommendations which may affect members of the public.\nOther information to be published under the\nIPS\nDefence proactively publishes other information that it holds (in addition to the information published under s 8(2)), taking into account the objects of the\nFOI\nAct (s 8(4)).\nIn keeping with improved accountability within Defence, from 20 January 2012,\nHot Issue Briefs\nsubmitted to the\nMinister for Defence by the Department of Defence\nare publicly released under the\nIPS\n.\nAdministering our\nIPS\nentry\nGovernance arrangements\nThe Assistant Secretary, Information, Management and Access (IMA) is the strategic manager of\nFOI\nprocesses, the\nIPS\n, and corporate information management more generally. The IMA Branch administers the Defence\nIPS\nentries and is responsible for implementing, reviewing and revising this plan.\nThe governance arrangements established to support information management improvements in Defence include an Information Management Steering Committee. With membership at 3 Star/Senior Executive Service Band 3 level from each Group and Service, the Committee sets the whole-of Defence direction for corporate information management. The committee is co-chaired by the\nDeputy Secretary\n,\nDefence Support and Reform Group\nand the\nChief Information Officer\n.\nInformation asset framework\nPublishing and managing the Defence\nIPS\nentries is undertaken in accordance with the existing Defence publishing framework, which consists of a set of processes underpinned by corporate strategies, policies and standards.\nIn 2014, the Defence Web Estate Manual was released and it provides governance and guidance for the preparation, authorisation and publishing of web content. Defence will continue to update its\nRecords Management Policy\nto address changes in the\nArchives Act 1983\nand Records in Evidence obligations, as well as the introduction of the\nGovernment's Digital Transition Policy\n.\nThe\nInformation Management Strategic Framework (IMSF)\nwhich was endorsed by the Defence Committee in 2010, brings together a set of principles and objectives that underpin a whole-of-Defence approach to Information Management.\nAccess\nIn keeping with the requirements of the whole-of-government\nWeb Accessibility National Transition Strategy\n, Defence has established a web team to improve web services and access to Defence information. The team is responsible for monitoring Defence's vast web environment and ensuring that the Defence websites comply with the Australian Government Information Management Office's web accessibility rating.\nRegister of information\nDefence maintains an internal register of information required or permitted to be published under the\nIPS\n. The register contains details on:\nthe business area and contact officer responsible for the information;\nwhen the information was last updated;\nwhen the information is next scheduled for review; and\nif a document is not published online, who the contact officer is to obtain a copy.\nCurrency\nDefence ensures its\nIPS\nentries are accurate, up to date and complete by undertaking the following:\nadhering to the internal\nIPS\nstandard operating procedures which set out roles and responsibilities, procedures to manage the\nIPS\ncontent, and a notification and review process for adding new content and reviewing existing content for currency and relevancy;\nadhering to section 11C of the\nFOI\nAct by publishing decisions and documents released under\nFOI\ntaking into consideration the Guidelines issued by the Australian Information Commissioner; and\ninviting public feedback on the\nIPS\n.\nCharges\nDefence will not charge for information provided by email. However, where information is requested in an alternative format (for example, a photocopy of the document) and the reimbursement or incidental costs would be more than $100, charges may apply. The charges that may apply are listed below.\nA list of charges\nFormat\nCharges\nPhotocopy\n10 cents per page\nCopy (other than photocopy)\n$4.40 per page\nCopy of the document in the form of a computer disk\nAn amount not exceeding the actual costs incurred by Defence in producing the copy\nCopy of the document to be sent to the applicant by post or delivered to the applicant\nAn amount not exceeding the cost of postage or delivery\nGenerally there will be no charge where the cost would be below $100.\nInformation architecture\nThe point of entry for public access to the Defence\nIPS\ncontent is the\nDefence website homepage\n.

Review Team\nServices\nOur\nIPS\nPlan\nPart 2 of the\nFreedom of Information Act 1982\n(\nFOI\nAct) establishes an\nInformation\nPublication Scheme\n(\nIPS\n) for Australian Government agencies subject to the\nFOI\nAct.\nThe IPS commenced on 1 May 2011 and requires the Department of Defence to\npublish a broad range of information on this website. Defence is also required\nto publish a plan that explains how the IPS is administered.\nThe\nIPS\nunderpins a pro-disclosure culture across government, and transforms\nthe freedom of information framework from one that is reactive to individual\nrequests for documents, to one that also relies more heavily on agency driven\npublication of information. The\nIPS\nrequirements are intended to facilitate and\npromote public access to information promptly and at the lowest reasonable cost.\nThis plan describes how Defence implements and administers its IPS entries as required by s 8(1) of the\nFOI\nAct, by addressing:\nadministration of the Defence\nIPS\nentries;\ninformation architecture;\ninformation required to be published;\nother information to be published; and\nIPS\ncompliance review.\nDefence will continue to build and foster a culture in which appropriate proactive disclosure of its information holdings is embraced. This is in recognition that public sector information is a national resource, managed for public purposes.\nPurpose\nThe purpose of this agency plan is to:\nassist Defence in maintaining and enhancing its\nIPS\nentries;\nfacilitate improved transparency about that entries; and\nfurther identify information for public release, as well as ways in which Defence can improve compliance with the\nIPS\nrequirements.\nObjectives\nDefence's objective is to outline appropriate mechanisms and procedures to:\nmanage its\nIPS\nentries;\nidentify and publish all information required to be published\n(s 8(2))\n;\nproactively identify and publish any other information to be published (s 8(4));\nreview on a regular basis and ensure that information published as part of its\nIPS\nentries is accurate, up to date and complete (s 8B);\nensure that information published as part of its\nIPS\nentries is easily discoverable, understandable, machine-readable, re-useable and transformable;\nensure satisfactory conformance with\nWeb Content Accessibility Guidelines (Version 2) (WCAG 2.0)\n;\nmeasure the success of the Defence\nIPS\nentries by reference to community feedback and compliance review processes; and\nreduce the number of formal requests under the\nFOI\nAct by making information that is\nroutinely sought\nreadily available and accessible.\nInformation required to be published under the\nIPS\nDefence has published mandatory information required under the\nIPS\n(s 8(2))\nas part of the top level information architecture and\nabout us\ninformation on the Defence website.\nThis includes:\na plan for the Information Publication Scheme (this plan);\nan\norganisation chart\nsetting out the structure of the organisation;\ndetails of our\nfunctions\n, including\ndecision-making powers\nand other powers affecting members of the public;\ndetails of\nappointments\nof officers made under Acts - such as appointments of\nstatutory officers\n;\nour\nannual reports\n;\ndetails of\nconsultation arrangements\nfor members of the public to comment on specific policy proposals for which Defence is responsible, including how (and to whom) those comments may be made;\ninformation which\nDefence routinely releases\nin response to\nFOI\nrequests\n;\ninformation that\nDefence routinely provides to the Parliament\nin response to requests and orders from the Parliament;\nhow we can be contacted about\naccess to information\nor\ndocuments under the\nFOI\nAct;\nand\nour\noperational information\n, insofar as it extends to our exercising functions and powers in making decisions or recommendations which may affect members of the public.\nOther information to be published under the\nIPS\nDefence proactively publishes other information that it holds (in addition to the information published under s 8(2)), taking into account the objects of the\nFOI\nAct (s 8(4)).\nIn keeping with improved accountability within Defence, from 20 January 2012,\nHot Issue Briefs\nsubmitted to the\nMinister for Defence by the Department of Defence\nare publicly released under the\nIPS\n.\nAdministering our\nIPS\nentry\nGovernance arrangements\nThe Assistant Secretary, Information, Management and Access (IMA) is the strategic manager of\nFOI\nprocesses, the\nIPS\n, and corporate information management more generally. The IMA Branch administers the Defence\nIPS\nentries and is responsible for implementing, reviewing and revising this plan.\nThe governance arrangements established to support information management improvements in Defence include an Information Management Steering Committee.

subject to the\nFOI\nAct.\nThe IPS commenced on 1 May 2011 and requires the Department of Defence to\npublish a broad range of information on this website. Defence is also required\nto publish a plan that explains how the IPS is administered.\nThe\nIPS\nunderpins a pro-disclosure culture across government, and transforms\nthe freedom of information framework from one that is reactive to individual\nrequests for documents, to one that also relies more heavily on agency driven\npublication of information. The\nIPS\nrequirements are intended to facilitate and\npromote public access to information promptly and at the lowest reasonable cost.\nThis plan describes how Defence implements and administers its IPS entries as required by s 8(1) of the\nFOI\nAct, by addressing:\nadministration of the Defence\nIPS\nentries;\ninformation architecture;\ninformation required to be published;\nother information to be published; and\nIPS\ncompliance review.\nDefence will continue to build and foster a culture in which appropriate proactive disclosure of its information holdings is embraced. This is in recognition that public sector information is a national resource, managed for public purposes.\nPurpose\nThe purpose of this agency plan is to:\nassist Defence in maintaining and enhancing its\nIPS\nentries;\nfacilitate improved transparency about that entries; and\nfurther identify information for public release, as well as ways in which Defence can improve compliance with the\nIPS\nrequirements.\nObjectives\nDefence's objective is to outline appropriate mechanisms and procedures to:\nmanage its\nIPS\nentries;\nidentify and publish all information required to be published\n(s 8(2))\n;\nproactively identify and publish any other information to be published (s 8(4));\nreview on a regular basis and ensure that information published as part of its\nIPS\nentries is accurate, up to date and complete (s 8B);\nensure that information published as part of its\nIPS\nentries is easily discoverable, understandable, machine-readable, re-useable and transformable;\nensure satisfactory conformance with\nWeb Content Accessibility Guidelines (Version 2) (WCAG 2.0)\n;\nmeasure the success of the Defence\nIPS\nentries by reference to community feedback and compliance review processes; and\nreduce the number of formal requests under the\nFOI\nAct by making information that is\nroutinely sought\nreadily available and accessible.\nInformation required to be published under the\nIPS\nDefence has published mandatory information required under the\nIPS\n(s 8(2))\nas part of the top level information architecture and\nabout us\ninformation on the Defence website.\nThis includes:\na plan for the Information Publication Scheme (this plan);\nan\norganisation chart\nsetting out the structure of the organisation;\ndetails of our\nfunctions\n, including\ndecision-making powers\nand other powers affecting members of the public;\ndetails of\nappointments\nof officers made under Acts - such as appointments of\nstatutory officers\n;\nour\nannual reports\n;\ndetails of\nconsultation arrangements\nfor members of the public to comment on specific policy proposals for which Defence is responsible, including how (and to whom) those comments may be made;\ninformation which\nDefence routinely releases\nin response to\nFOI\nrequests\n;\ninformation that\nDefence routinely provides to the Parliament\nin response to requests and orders from the Parliament;\nhow we can be contacted about\naccess to information\nor\ndocuments under the\nFOI\nAct;\nand\nour\noperational information\n, insofar as it extends to our exercising functions and powers in making decisions or recommendations which may affect members of the public.\nOther information to be published under the\nIPS\nDefence proactively publishes other information that it holds (in addition to the information published under s 8(2)), taking into account the objects of the\nFOI\nAct (s 8(4)).\nIn keeping with improved accountability within Defence, from 20 January 2012,\nHot Issue Briefs\nsubmitted to the\nMinister for Defence by the Department of Defence\nare publicly released under the\nIPS\n.\nAdministering our\nIPS\nentry\nGovernance arrangements\nThe Assistant Secretary, Information, Management and Access (IMA) is the strategic manager of\nFOI\nprocesses, the\nIPS\n, and corporate information management more generally.
