Review Team\nServices\nOur\nIPS\nPlan\nPart 2 of the\nFreedom of Information Act 1982\n(\nFOI\nAct) establishes an\nInformation\nPublication Scheme\n(\nIPS\n) for Australian Government agencies subject to the\nFOI\nAct.\nThe IPS commenced on 1 May 2011 and requires the Department of Defence to\npublish a broad range of information on this website. Defence is also required\nto publish a plan that explains how the IPS is administered.\nThe\nIPS\nunderpins a pro-disclosure culture across government, and transforms\nthe freedom of information framework from one that is reactive to individual\nrequests for documents, to one that also relies more heavily on agency driven\npublication of information. The\nIPS\nrequirements are intended to facilitate and\npromote public access to information promptly and at the lowest reasonable cost.\nThis plan describes how Defence implements and administers its IPS entries as required by s 8(1) of the\nFOI\nAct, by addressing:\nadministration of the Defence\nIPS\nentries;\ninformation architecture;\ninformation required to be published;\nother information to be published; and\nIPS\ncompliance review.\nDefence will continue to build and foster a culture in which appropriate proactive disclosure of its information holdings is embraced. This is in recognition that public sector information is a national resource, managed for public purposes.\nPurpose\nThe purpose of this agency plan is to:\nassist Defence in maintaining and enhancing its\nIPS\nentries;\nfacilitate improved transparency about that entries; and\nfurther identify information for public release, as well as ways in which Defence can improve compliance with the\nIPS\nrequirements.\nObjectives\nDefence's objective is to outline appropriate mechanisms and procedures to:\nmanage its\nIPS\nentries;\nidentify and publish all information required to be published\n(s 8(2))\n;\nproactively identify and publish any other information to be published (s 8(4));\nreview on a regular basis and ensure that information published as part of its\nIPS\nentries is accurate, up to date and complete (s 8B);\nensure that information published as part of its\nIPS\nentries is easily discoverable, understandable, machine-readable, re-useable and transformable;\nensure satisfactory conformance with\nWeb Content Accessibility Guidelines (Version 2) (WCAG 2.0)\n;\nmeasure the success of the Defence\nIPS\nentries by reference to community feedback and compliance review processes; and\nreduce the number of formal requests under the\nFOI\nAct by making information that is\nroutinely sought\nreadily available and accessible.\nInformation required to be published under the\nIPS\nDefence has published mandatory information required under the\nIPS\n(s 8(2))\nas part of the top level information architecture and\nabout us\ninformation on the Defence website.\nThis includes:\na plan for the Information Publication Scheme (this plan);\nan\norganisation chart\nsetting out the structure of the organisation;\ndetails of our\nfunctions\n, including\ndecision-making powers\nand other powers affecting members of the public;\ndetails of\nappointments\nof officers made under Acts - such as appointments of\nstatutory officers\n;\nour\nannual reports\n;\ndetails of\nconsultation arrangements\nfor members of the public to comment on specific policy proposals for which Defence is responsible, including how (and to whom) those comments may be made;\ninformation which\nDefence routinely releases\nin response to\nFOI\nrequests\n;\ninformation that\nDefence routinely provides to the Parliament\nin response to requests and orders from the Parliament;\nhow we can be contacted about\naccess to information\nor\ndocuments under the\nFOI\nAct;\nand\nour\noperational information\n, insofar as it extends to our exercising functions and powers in making decisions or recommendations which may affect members of the public.\nOther information to be published under the\nIPS\nDefence proactively publishes other information that it holds (in addition to the information published under s 8(2)), taking into account the objects of the\nFOI\nAct (s 8(4)).\nIn keeping with improved accountability within Defence, from 20 January 2012,\nHot Issue Briefs\nsubmitted to the\nMinister for Defence by the Department of Defence\nare publicly released under the\nIPS\n.\nAdministering our\nIPS\nentry\nGovernance arrangements\nThe Assistant Secretary, Information, Management and Access (IMA) is the strategic manager of\nFOI\nprocesses, the\nIPS\n, and corporate information management more generally. The IMA Branch administers the Defence\nIPS\nentries and is responsible for implementing, reviewing and revising this plan.\nThe governance arrangements established to support information management improvements in Defence include an Information Management Steering Committee. With membership at 3 Star/Senior Executive Service Band 3 level from each Group and Service, the Committee sets the whole-of Defence direction for corporate information management. The committee is co-chaired by the\nDeputy Secretary\n,\nDefence Support and Reform Group\nand the\nChief Information Officer\n.\nInformation asset framework\nPublishing and managing the Defence\nIPS\nentries is undertaken in accordance with the existing Defence publishing framework, which consists of a set of processes underpinned by corporate strategies, policies and standards.\nIn 2014, the Defence Web Estate Manual was released and it provides governance and guidance for the preparation, authorisation and publishing of web content. Defence will continue to update its\nRecords Management Policy\nto address changes in the\nArchives Act 1983\nand Records in Evidence obligations, as well as the introduction of the\nGovernment's Digital Transition Policy\n.\nThe\nInformation Management Strategic Framework (IMSF)\nwhich was endorsed by the Defence Committee in 2010, brings together a set of principles and objectives that underpin a whole-of-Defence approach to Information Management.\nAccess\nIn keeping with the requirements of the whole-of-government\nWeb Accessibility National Transition Strategy\n, Defence has established a web team to improve web services and access to Defence information. The team is responsible for monitoring Defence's vast web environment and ensuring that the Defence websites comply with the Australian Government Information Management Office's web accessibility rating.\nRegister of information\nDefence maintains an internal register of information required or permitted to be published under the\nIPS\n. The register contains details on:\nthe business area and contact officer responsible for the information;\nwhen the information was last updated;\nwhen the information is next scheduled for review; and\nif a document is not published online, who the contact officer is to obtain a copy.\nCurrency\nDefence ensures its\nIPS\nentries are accurate, up to date and complete by undertaking the following:\nadhering to the internal\nIPS\nstandard operating procedures which set out roles and responsibilities, procedures to manage the\nIPS\ncontent, and a notification and review process for adding new content and reviewing existing content for currency and relevancy;\nadhering to section 11C of the\nFOI\nAct by publishing decisions and documents released under\nFOI\ntaking into consideration the Guidelines issued by the Australian Information Commissioner; and\ninviting public feedback on the\nIPS\n.\nCharges\nDefence will not charge for information provided by email. However, where information is requested in an alternative format (for example, a photocopy of the document) and the reimbursement or incidental costs would be more than $100, charges may apply. The charges that may apply are listed below.\nA list of charges\nFormat\nCharges\nPhotocopy\n10 cents per page\nCopy (other than photocopy)\n$4.40 per page\nCopy of the document in the form of a computer disk\nAn amount not exceeding the actual costs incurred by Defence in producing the copy\nCopy of the document to be sent to the applicant by post or delivered to the applicant\nAn amount not exceeding the cost of postage or delivery\nGenerally there will be no charge where the cost would be below $100.\nInformation architecture\nThe point of entry for public access to the Defence\nIPS\ncontent is the\nDefence website homepage\n.

Review Team\nServices\nOur\nIPS\nPlan\nPart 2 of the\nFreedom of Information Act 1982\n(\nFOI\nAct) establishes an\nInformation\nPublication Scheme\n(\nIPS\n) for Australian Government agencies subject to the\nFOI\nAct.\nThe IPS commenced on 1 May 2011 and requires the Department of Defence to\npublish a broad range of information on this website. Defence is also required\nto publish a plan that explains how the IPS is administered.\nThe\nIPS\nunderpins a pro-disclosure culture across government, and transforms\nthe freedom of information framework from one that is reactive to individual\nrequests for documents, to one that also relies more heavily on agency driven\npublication of information. The\nIPS\nrequirements are intended to facilitate and\npromote public access to information promptly and at the lowest reasonable cost.\nThis plan describes how Defence implements and administers its IPS entries as required by s 8(1) of the\nFOI\nAct, by addressing:\nadministration of the Defence\nIPS\nentries;\ninformation architecture;\ninformation required to be published;\nother information to be published; and\nIPS\ncompliance review.\nDefence will continue to build and foster a culture in which appropriate proactive disclosure of its information holdings is embraced. This is in recognition that public sector information is a national resource, managed for public purposes.\nPurpose\nThe purpose of this agency plan is to:\nassist Defence in maintaining and enhancing its\nIPS\nentries;\nfacilitate improved transparency about that entries; and\nfurther identify information for public release, as well as ways in which Defence can improve compliance with the\nIPS\nrequirements.\nObjectives\nDefence's objective is to outline appropriate mechanisms and procedures to:\nmanage its\nIPS\nentries;\nidentify and publish all information required to be published\n(s 8(2))\n;\nproactively identify and publish any other information to be published (s 8(4));\nreview on a regular basis and ensure that information published as part of its\nIPS\nentries is accurate, up to date and complete (s 8B);\nensure that information published as part of its\nIPS\nentries is easily discoverable, understandable, machine-readable, re-useable and transformable;\nensure satisfactory conformance with\nWeb Content Accessibility Guidelines (Version 2) (WCAG 2.0)\n;\nmeasure the success of the Defence\nIPS\nentries by reference to community feedback and compliance review processes; and\nreduce the number of formal requests under the\nFOI\nAct by making information that is\nroutinely sought\nreadily available and accessible.\nInformation required to be published under the\nIPS\nDefence has published mandatory information required under the\nIPS\n(s 8(2))\nas part of the top level information architecture and\nabout us\ninformation on the Defence website.\nThis includes:\na plan for the Information Publication Scheme (this plan);\nan\norganisation chart\nsetting out the structure of the organisation;\ndetails of our\nfunctions\n, including\ndecision-making powers\nand other powers affecting members of the public;\ndetails of\nappointments\nof officers made under Acts - such as appointments of\nstatutory officers\n;\nour\nannual reports\n;\ndetails of\nconsultation arrangements\nfor members of the public to comment on specific policy proposals for which Defence is responsible, including how (and to whom) those comments may be made;\ninformation which\nDefence routinely releases\nin response to\nFOI\nrequests\n;\ninformation that\nDefence routinely provides to the Parliament\nin response to requests and orders from the Parliament;\nhow we can be contacted about\naccess to information\nor\ndocuments under the\nFOI\nAct;\nand\nour\noperational information\n, insofar as it extends to our exercising functions and powers in making decisions or recommendations which may affect members of the public.\nOther information to be published under the\nIPS\nDefence proactively publishes other information that it holds (in addition to the information published under s 8(2)), taking into account the objects of the\nFOI\nAct (s 8(4)).\nIn keeping with improved accountability within Defence, from 20 January 2012,\nHot Issue Briefs\nsubmitted to the\nMinister for Defence by the Department of Defence\nare publicly released under the\nIPS\n.\nAdministering our\nIPS\nentry\nGovernance arrangements\nThe Assistant Secretary, Information, Management and Access (IMA) is the strategic manager of\nFOI\nprocesses, the\nIPS\n, and corporate information management more generally. The IMA Branch administers the Defence\nIPS\nentries and is responsible for implementing, reviewing and revising this plan.\nThe governance arrangements established to support information management improvements in Defence include an Information Management Steering Committee. With membership at 3 Star/Senior Executive Service Band 3 level from each Group and Service, the Committee sets the whole-of Defence direction for corporate information management. The committee is co-chaired by the\nDeputy Secretary\n,\nDefence Support and Reform Group\nand the\nChief Information Officer\n.\nInformation asset framework\nPublishing and managing the Defence\nIPS\nentries is undertaken in accordance with the existing Defence publishing framework, which consists of a set of processes underpinned by corporate strategies, policies and standards.\nIn 2014, the Defence Web Estate Manual was released and it provides governance and guidance for the preparation, authorisation and publishing of web content. Defence will continue to update its\nRecords Management Policy\nto address changes in the\nArchives Act 1983\nand Records in Evidence obligations, as well as the introduction of the\nGovernment's Digital Transition Policy\n.\nThe\nInformation Management Strategic Framework (IMSF)\nwhich was endorsed by the Defence Committee in 2010, brings together a set of principles and objectives that underpin a whole-of-Defence approach to Information Management.\nAccess\nIn keeping with the requirements of the whole-of-government\nWeb Accessibility National Transition Strategy\n, Defence has established a web team to improve web services and access to Defence information. The team is responsible for monitoring Defence's vast web environment and ensuring that the Defence websites comply with the Australian Government Information Management Office's web accessibility rating.\nRegister of information\nDefence maintains an internal register of information required or permitted to be published under the\nIPS\n. The register contains details on:\nthe business area and contact officer responsible for the information;\nwhen the information was last updated;\nwhen the information is next scheduled for review; and\nif a document is not published online, who the contact officer is to obtain a copy.\nCurrency\nDefence ensures its\nIPS\nentries are accurate, up to date and complete by undertaking the following:\nadhering to the internal\nIPS\nstandard operating procedures which set out roles and responsibilities, procedures to manage the\nIPS\ncontent, and a notification and review process for adding new content and reviewing existing content for currency and relevancy;\nadhering to section 11C of the\nFOI\nAct by publishing decisions and documents released under\nFOI\ntaking into consideration the Guidelines issued by the Australian Information Commissioner; and\ninviting public feedback on the\nIPS\n.\nCharges\nDefence will not charge for information provided by email. However, where information is requested in an alternative format (for example, a photocopy of the document) and the reimbursement or incidental costs would be more than $100, charges may apply. The charges that may apply are listed below.\nA list of charges\nFormat\nCharges\nPhotocopy\n10 cents per page\nCopy (other than photocopy)\n$4.40 per page\nCopy of the document in the form of a computer disk\nAn amount not exceeding the actual costs incurred by Defence in producing the copy\nCopy of the document to be sent to the applicant by post or delivered to the applicant\nAn amount not exceeding the cost of postage or delivery\nGenerally there will be no charge where the cost would be below $100.\nInformation architecture\nThe point of entry for public access to the Defence\nIPS\ncontent is the\nDefence website homepage\n.

Review Team\nServices\nOur\nIPS\nPlan\nPart 2 of the\nFreedom of Information Act 1982\n(\nFOI\nAct) establishes an\nInformation\nPublication Scheme\n(\nIPS\n) for Australian Government agencies subject to the\nFOI\nAct.\nThe IPS commenced on 1 May 2011 and requires the Department of Defence to\npublish a broad range of information on this website. Defence is also required\nto publish a plan that explains how the IPS is administered.\nThe\nIPS\nunderpins a pro-disclosure culture across government, and transforms\nthe freedom of information framework from one that is reactive to individual\nrequests for documents, to one that also relies more heavily on agency driven\npublication of information. The\nIPS\nrequirements are intended to facilitate and\npromote public access to information promptly and at the lowest reasonable cost.\nThis plan describes how Defence implements and administers its IPS entries as required by s 8(1) of the\nFOI\nAct, by addressing:\nadministration of the Defence\nIPS\nentries;\ninformation architecture;\ninformation required to be published;\nother information to be published; and\nIPS\ncompliance review.\nDefence will continue to build and foster a culture in which appropriate proactive disclosure of its information holdings is embraced. This is in recognition that public sector information is a national resource, managed for public purposes.\nPurpose\nThe purpose of this agency plan is to:\nassist Defence in maintaining and enhancing its\nIPS\nentries;\nfacilitate improved transparency about that entries; and\nfurther identify information for public release, as well as ways in which Defence can improve compliance with the\nIPS\nrequirements.\nObjectives\nDefence's objective is to outline appropriate mechanisms and procedures to:\nmanage its\nIPS\nentries;\nidentify and publish all information required to be published\n(s 8(2))\n;\nproactively identify and publish any other information to be published (s 8(4));\nreview on a regular basis and ensure that information published as part of its\nIPS\nentries is accurate, up to date and complete (s 8B);\nensure that information published as part of its\nIPS\nentries is easily discoverable, understandable, machine-readable, re-useable and transformable;\nensure satisfactory conformance with\nWeb Content Accessibility Guidelines (Version 2) (WCAG 2.0)\n;\nmeasure the success of the Defence\nIPS\nentries by reference to community feedback and compliance review processes; and\nreduce the number of formal requests under the\nFOI\nAct by making information that is\nroutinely sought\nreadily available and accessible.\nInformation required to be published under the\nIPS\nDefence has published mandatory information required under the\nIPS\n(s 8(2))\nas part of the top level information architecture and\nabout us\ninformation on the Defence website.\nThis includes:\na plan for the Information Publication Scheme (this plan);\nan\norganisation chart\nsetting out the structure of the organisation;\ndetails of our\nfunctions\n, including\ndecision-making powers\nand other powers affecting members of the public;\ndetails of\nappointments\nof officers made under Acts - such as appointments of\nstatutory officers\n;\nour\nannual reports\n;\ndetails of\nconsultation arrangements\nfor members of the public to comment on specific policy proposals for which Defence is responsible, including how (and to whom) those comments may be made;\ninformation which\nDefence routinely releases\nin response to\nFOI\nrequests\n;\ninformation that\nDefence routinely provides to the Parliament\nin response to requests and orders from the Parliament;\nhow we can be contacted about\naccess to information\nor\ndocuments under the\nFOI\nAct;\nand\nour\noperational information\n, insofar as it extends to our exercising functions and powers in making decisions or recommendations which may affect members of the public.\nOther information to be published under the\nIPS\nDefence proactively publishes other information that it holds (in addition to the information published under s 8(2)), taking into account the objects of the\nFOI\nAct (s 8(4)).\nIn keeping with improved accountability within Defence, from 20 January 2012,\nHot Issue Briefs\nsubmitted to the\nMinister for Defence by the Department of Defence\nare publicly released under the\nIPS\n.\nAdministering our\nIPS\nentry\nGovernance arrangements\nThe Assistant Secretary, Information, Management and Access (IMA) is the strategic manager of\nFOI\nprocesses, the\nIPS\n, and corporate information management more generally. The IMA Branch administers the Defence\nIPS\nentries and is responsible for implementing, reviewing and revising this plan.\nThe governance arrangements established to support information management improvements in Defence include an Information Management Steering Committee.

subject to the\nFOI\nAct.\nThe IPS commenced on 1 May 2011 and requires the Department of Defence to\npublish a broad range of information on this website. Defence is also required\nto publish a plan that explains how the IPS is administered.\nThe\nIPS\nunderpins a pro-disclosure culture across government, and transforms\nthe freedom of information framework from one that is reactive to individual\nrequests for documents, to one that also relies more heavily on agency driven\npublication of information. The\nIPS\nrequirements are intended to facilitate and\npromote public access to information promptly and at the lowest reasonable cost.\nThis plan describes how Defence implements and administers its IPS entries as required by s 8(1) of the\nFOI\nAct, by addressing:\nadministration of the Defence\nIPS\nentries;\ninformation architecture;\ninformation required to be published;\nother information to be published; and\nIPS\ncompliance review.\nDefence will continue to build and foster a culture in which appropriate proactive disclosure of its information holdings is embraced. This is in recognition that public sector information is a national resource, managed for public purposes.\nPurpose\nThe purpose of this agency plan is to:\nassist Defence in maintaining and enhancing its\nIPS\nentries;\nfacilitate improved transparency about that entries; and\nfurther identify information for public release, as well as ways in which Defence can improve compliance with the\nIPS\nrequirements.\nObjectives\nDefence's objective is to outline appropriate mechanisms and procedures to:\nmanage its\nIPS\nentries;\nidentify and publish all information required to be published\n(s 8(2))\n;\nproactively identify and publish any other information to be published (s 8(4));\nreview on a regular basis and ensure that information published as part of its\nIPS\nentries is accurate, up to date and complete (s 8B);\nensure that information published as part of its\nIPS\nentries is easily discoverable, understandable, machine-readable, re-useable and transformable;\nensure satisfactory conformance with\nWeb Content Accessibility Guidelines (Version 2) (WCAG 2.0)\n;\nmeasure the success of the Defence\nIPS\nentries by reference to community feedback and compliance review processes; and\nreduce the number of formal requests under the\nFOI\nAct by making information that is\nroutinely sought\nreadily available and accessible.\nInformation required to be published under the\nIPS\nDefence has published mandatory information required under the\nIPS\n(s 8(2))\nas part of the top level information architecture and\nabout us\ninformation on the Defence website.\nThis includes:\na plan for the Information Publication Scheme (this plan);\nan\norganisation chart\nsetting out the structure of the organisation;\ndetails of our\nfunctions\n, including\ndecision-making powers\nand other powers affecting members of the public;\ndetails of\nappointments\nof officers made under Acts - such as appointments of\nstatutory officers\n;\nour\nannual reports\n;\ndetails of\nconsultation arrangements\nfor members of the public to comment on specific policy proposals for which Defence is responsible, including how (and to whom) those comments may be made;\ninformation which\nDefence routinely releases\nin response to\nFOI\nrequests\n;\ninformation that\nDefence routinely provides to the Parliament\nin response to requests and orders from the Parliament;\nhow we can be contacted about\naccess to information\nor\ndocuments under the\nFOI\nAct;\nand\nour\noperational information\n, insofar as it extends to our exercising functions and powers in making decisions or recommendations which may affect members of the public.\nOther information to be published under the\nIPS\nDefence proactively publishes other information that it holds (in addition to the information published under s 8(2)), taking into account the objects of the\nFOI\nAct (s 8(4)).\nIn keeping with improved accountability within Defence, from 20 January 2012,\nHot Issue Briefs\nsubmitted to the\nMinister for Defence by the Department of Defence\nare publicly released under the\nIPS\n.\nAdministering our\nIPS\nentry\nGovernance arrangements\nThe Assistant Secretary, Information, Management and Access (IMA) is the strategic manager of\nFOI\nprocesses, the\nIPS\n, and corporate information management more generally. The IMA Branch administers the Defence\nIPS\nentries and is responsible for implementing, reviewing and revising this plan.\nThe governance arrangements established to support information management improvements in Defence include an Information Management Steering Committee.

Review Team\nServices\nMedia Release\nRELEASE OF THE SEA KING BOARD OF INQUIRY REPORT\nChief of Navy, Vice Admiral Russ Shalders AO, CSC, RAN, today released the Board of Inquiry (BOI) Report into the loss of Navy helicopter\n'SHARK 02'\n, which crashed on Nias, Indonesia on 2 April 2005.\nNine Navy and Air Force members were killed and two seriously injured in the accident. The flight crew and medical personnel were providing humanitarian aid as part of Operation SUMATRA ASSIST II following the Nias earthquake.\nUnder the wide ranging Terms of Reference, the Navy Appointing Authority empowered the BOI to not only examine the factors that directly contributed to this tragic accident, but to also critically examine many other associated areas including operations, flight safety, logistics support and personnel management. \n \"After a meticulous examination of the evidence presented during the inquiry, the Board concluded that the primary cause of the accident was a failure of the flight control system.  A key component of the flight control system was not properly secured during maintenance, which resulted in the pilots losing ability to control the aircraft. This was the result of a series of errors and non-compliances with Maintenance Regulations\" Admiral Shalders said.\n\"In the opinion of the Board change is required to improve aviation safety.  I agree with this conclusion and the ADF views the recommendations as an opportunity to further improve Defence's current high standards of operational performance and safety.\n\"The loss of nine Navy and Air Force personnel is deeply felt. This accident was a tragedy and only by learning from our mistakes can we demonstrate that they did not die in vain. We will honour their memories by making flying safer,\" Admiral Shalders said.\nThe report includes several far-reaching recommendations for cultural and organisational change to improve Navy Aviation safety performance and to make improvements in some areas of ADF aviation that will require the engagement and commitment of senior leaders.\nChief of the Defence Force, Air Chief Marshal Angus Houston AO, AFC, said he was personally committed to ensuring the implementation of all the Board's recommendations.\n\"I have established a dedicated Implementation Team headed by a Senior Officer to ensure that the recommendations are properly implemented.  I have also directed that the Implementation Team provide a quarterly report on their progress to the Chiefs of Service Committee, the most senior management group in the ADF.\n\"Defence will continue the policy of openness and transparency that it has maintained throughout the BOI period by providing routine public updates on its progress in implementing the Board's recommendations. This progress will also be detailed in subsequent Defence Annual Reports.\n\"In order to ensure the survivors and families of the victims are kept fully informed of our progress in implementing the recommendations, I have also directed the Implementation Team offer to brief them on a quarterly basis.\n\"The ADF Airworthiness System is a robust system but we must learn from the mistakes of the Sea King tragedy.\n\"A review of the airworthiness system is currently underway. The review is wide ranging and will look at, among other things, the need to improve and strengthen the auditing, compliance and intervention aspects of the system,\" Air Chief Marshal Houston said.\nNavy has not waited for the release of the report to begin the process of improving safety practices. A Maintenance Reinvigoration Program was launched in 2005 with seventy two specific aims for improving aviation safety. By 30 June 2007 , all but four of the tasks will have been implemented.\nSubject to independent verification by the implementation team, 30 per cent of recommendations made by the Sea King Board of Inquiry have been completed and further 60 per cent will be complete by December 2007.\nImprovements to date include adjusting Navy flying rates to ensure safe operations; the institution of programs to educate Navy staff about human factors in maintenance and correct maintenance practices; and the alteration of Navy Squadron maintenance structures to ensure appropriate levels of supervision.\nThe Sea King's manufacturer Westland Helicopters, has also been commissioned to improve fuel system components and install new crashworthy seats into Sea King aircraft by December 2007.\nNext of Kin and the NSW Coroner have been briefed on the Board's findings and recommendations. The Defence Community Organisation will continue to offer ongoing support to the families of those who were killed and also to the survivors of the accident.\n \nSpeaking Notes\nAir Chief Marshal

Review Team\nServices\nMedia Release\nRELEASE OF THE SEA KING BOARD OF INQUIRY REPORT\nChief of Navy, Vice Admiral Russ Shalders AO, CSC, RAN, today released the Board of Inquiry (BOI) Report into the loss of Navy helicopter\n'SHARK 02'\n, which crashed on Nias, Indonesia on 2 April 2005.\nNine Navy and Air Force members were killed and two seriously injured in the accident. The flight crew and medical personnel were providing humanitarian aid as part of Operation SUMATRA ASSIST II following the Nias earthquake.\nUnder the wide ranging Terms of Reference, the Navy Appointing Authority empowered the BOI to not only examine the factors that directly contributed to this tragic accident, but to also critically examine many other associated areas including operations, flight safety, logistics support and personnel management. \n \"After a meticulous examination of the evidence presented during the inquiry, the Board concluded that the primary cause of the accident was a failure of the flight control system.  A key component of the flight control system was not properly secured during maintenance, which resulted in the pilots losing ability to control the aircraft. This was the result of a series of errors and non-compliances with Maintenance Regulations\" Admiral Shalders said.\n\"In the opinion of the Board change is required to improve aviation safety.  I agree with this conclusion and the ADF views the recommendations as an opportunity to further improve Defence's current high standards of operational performance and safety.\n\"The loss of nine Navy and Air Force personnel is deeply felt. This accident was a tragedy and only by learning from our mistakes can we demonstrate that they did not die in vain. We will honour their memories by making flying safer,\" Admiral Shalders said.\nThe report includes several far-reaching recommendations for cultural and organisational change to improve Navy Aviation safety performance and to make improvements in some areas of ADF aviation that will require the engagement and commitment of senior leaders.\nChief of the Defence Force, Air Chief Marshal Angus Houston AO, AFC, said he was personally committed to ensuring the implementation of all the Board's recommendations.\n\"I have established a dedicated Implementation Team headed by a Senior Officer to ensure that the recommendations are properly implemented.  I have also directed that the Implementation Team provide a quarterly report on their progress to the Chiefs of Service Committee, the most senior management group in the ADF.\n\"Defence will continue the policy of openness and transparency that it has maintained throughout the BOI period by providing routine public updates on its progress in implementing the Board's recommendations. This progress will also be detailed in subsequent Defence Annual Reports.\n\"In order to ensure the survivors and families of the victims are kept fully informed of our progress in implementing the recommendations, I have also directed the Implementation Team offer to brief them on a quarterly basis.\n\"The ADF Airworthiness System is a robust system but we must learn from the mistakes of the Sea King tragedy.\n\"A review of the airworthiness system is currently underway. The review is wide ranging and will look at, among other things, the need to improve and strengthen the auditing, compliance and intervention aspects of the system,\" Air Chief Marshal Houston said.\nNavy has not waited for the release of the report to begin the process of improving safety practices. A Maintenance Reinvigoration Program was launched in 2005 with seventy two specific aims for improving aviation safety. By 30 June 2007 , all but four of the tasks will have been implemented.\nSubject to independent verification by the implementation team, 30 per cent of recommendations made by the Sea King Board of Inquiry have been completed and further 60 per cent will be complete by December 2007.\nImprovements to date include adjusting Navy flying rates to ensure safe operations; the institution of programs to educate Navy staff about human factors in maintenance and correct maintenance practices; and the alteration of Navy Squadron maintenance structures to ensure appropriate levels of supervision.\nThe Sea King's manufacturer Westland Helicopters, has also been commissioned to improve fuel system components and install new crashworthy seats into Sea King aircraft by December 2007.\nNext of Kin and the NSW Coroner have been briefed on the Board's findings and recommendations. The Defence Community Organisation will continue to offer ongoing support to the families of those who were killed and also to the survivors of the accident.\n \nSpeaking Notes\nAir Chief Marshal

capacity of Garden Island in Sydney to\naccommodate increased numbers of visiting cruise ships. The review will assess\ncurrent and future Royal Australian Navy (RAN) requirements and whether there is\nscope to enhance cruise ship access to Garden Island, noting its primary role of\nsupport to the RAN's raise, train and sustain roles and functions and the timely\ndelivery of maritime operational capability.\nThe review is to examine:\nOutcomes from the New South\nWales Government-sponsored Passenger Cruise Terminal Steering\nCommittee Part B report on infrastructure requirements and\nlocations for a Cruise Passenger Terminal east of Sydney Harbour\nBridge;\nCurrent and future RAN\nrequirements for facilities at Garden Island to meet the\noperational and maintenance needs of home-ported and visiting\nRAN and allied naval ships;\nFuture Defence Materiel\nOrganisation requirements and responsibilities for contracted\nRAN ship repair and maintenance, including the continuing need\nfor Garden Island to be available for short notice emergency\nNavy dockings;\nThe suitability of existing\nGarden Island facilities to support more regular cruise ship\nvisits during peak periods and with the degree of advanced\nnotice sought by the industry;\nThe economic benefits of\nenhanced cruise ship access to Sydney Harbour, and the economic\ncontribution of the ongoing Navy presence in Sydney;\nOptions for alternative\nberthing, maintenance and support arrangements for naval vessels\nboth within Sydney and other ports which might be required to\nallow enhanced cruise ship access to Garden Island during peak\nperiods, with estimates of feasibility, costs and timeframes\ninvolved;\nThe costs, benefits and impact\nof the cruise industry investing in purpose built facilities at\nGarden Island to enable enhanced use of the island by cruise\nships;\nChanges to Defence risk profile\nwhich would be caused by enhanced cruise ship access to Garden\nIsland, in terms of:\nAcquisition and\nmaintenance of naval ships;\nPersonnel support;\nSecurity;\nOperational\nreadiness; and\nCommonwealth\nfinancial and legal liability.\nThe review will be guided by the following:\nThe Two Ocean Basing policy,\nwhich will remain a central tenet of Navy basing and disposition\nfor Navy's larger ships, consistent with strategic guidance.\nThe strategic basing principles\nagreed by the Government as part of the 2009\nDefence White Paper Defending Australia in the Asia Pacific Century: Force 2030\n.\nAn understanding of the\ntechnical complexity of major naval vessels, and how this might\ndetermine the need for operational bases having ready access to\na broad industry base with specialised dockyard facilities and a\nlarge labour force possessing trades and skills peculiar to\nnaval requirements.\nThe impact of basing Navy ships\nin major ports such as Sydney on Navy skilled workforce\nretention.\nThe review will seek wide input from Commonwealth and State Governments,\nSydney and other Port Corporations, defence contractors in the ship repair\nsector, cruise industry representatives, ports and shipping industry\nrepresentative bodies, the transport and tourism sectors, and the team appointed\nby Government to undertake the broader Force Posture Review.\nThe review is to commence as soon as possible with a final report tabled to\nthe Minister for Defence by the end of December 2011.\nDefence Service \u0026

King helicopter\nShark 02\ncrashed on the island of Nias , Indonesia , while participating in an Australian Defence Force (ADF) humanitarian aid Operation Sumatra Assist II. This accident resulted in the tragic deaths of nine ADF members and serious injuries to a further two.\nThe Maritime Commander Australia (now the Fleet Commander) Rear Admiral Davyd Thomas AM, CSC, RAN appointed a Board of Inquiry to determine the factors contributing to the accident and make recommendations for preventing a similar tragedy. The Board consisted of five people with expertise in ADF operations, aviation, engineering and psychology.\nThe Inquiry considered 44 Terms of Reference and was conducted in an open and transparent manner with public hearings and the hearing transcript published on the Internet. The Board deliberated for almost 20 months, considered evidence from more than 160 witnesses, reviewed 560 exhibits, conducted hearings over 111 days and produced approximately 10,000 pages of transcript.\nThe Board's Report was submitted to the Fleet Commander as the Appointing Authority on 18 December 2006 . The Board was officially dissolved by RADM Thomas on 11 April 07. It is approximately 1,700 pages long and consists of 759 Findings and 256 Recommendations for improving aviation safety.\nNavy accepts that the accident should not have happened and takes full responsibility. Navy and Defence will fix the safety problems identified in the Report by implementing all of the Board's recommendations in full. Navy did not wait however, for the Report's release before beginning to rectify aviation safety problems.\nUpon receipt of the Report, a Board of Inquiry Implementation Team distributed the Recommendations and Findings to 27 Implementing Authorities who assessed how the Recommendations could be enacted, their resource implications and what the estimated completion date would be.\nIn the period between the receipt of the Board's Report 18 December 2006 and the dissolution of the Board on 11 April 2007 the Board further reviewed the Report and directed that a number of changes be made. Some of these changes were made in the light of an independent legal review undertaken to ensure that the Report adequately addressed the Terms of Reference and that the conclusions were supported by evidence. Also, in preparing the Report for release minor corrections have been included where they do not make substantive change to the Report.\nFurther, some paragraphs and sentences are not published. Some of these are not published due to issues of jurisdiction of the Board and procedural fairness. These matters have been the subject of legal advice from senior counsel. In addition, some material has not been published because publication would be an unreasonable disclosure of personal information of the deceased or because of operational security. Details regarding the changes and the material which is not published are set out in a Preface and a Table of Amendments.\nAn Implementation Plan is being released along with the Report. Subject to independent verification, 30 per cent of recommendations have already been completed and a further 60 percent will be fully implemented by December 2007.\nBy improving aviation safety, Navy and Defence will demonstrate that it has learnt from this tragedy.\nInformation current at 13 June 2007\nDefence Service \u0026 Personnel Records\nFreedom of Information\nInformation Publication

To ensure these changes are implemented, the Chief of the Defence Force (CDF) has directed that the following five step strategy be adopted;\n1.      A specialist Implementation Team headed by a Senior Officer has been established to ensure adequate governance and that the recommendations are properly implemented.\n2.      The Implementation Team will develop implementation strategies for each recommendation including milestones for achievement and measures of success.\n3 To ensure the highest level of oversight, the CDF has directed that this Implementation Team report to the Chiefs of Service Committee, the most senior management group in ADF quarterly.\n4.      Defence will continue the policy of openness and transparency that it has maintained throughout the BOI period, by providing routine public updates on its progress in implementing the Report's recommendations.  Additionally, achievements against the recommendations will be detailed in future Defence Annual Reports.\n5.      In order to ensure the survivors and families of the victims are kept fully informed of our progress in implementing the recommendations, CDF has directed the Implementation Team offer to brief them on a quarterly basis.\nRecommendation themes\nDefence has accepted all 256 recommendations of the report which can be broadly grouped into the following eight themes:\nAirworthiness\n\u0026#149;  There are 35 recommendations to improve the ADF Airworthiness system. Significantly the Chief of Air Force, as the ADF Airworthiness Authority, has initiated a strategic review of the ADF Airworthiness Management System that will consider the structure of the organisation that manages airworthiness, the effectiveness of current airworthiness processes and the adequacy of resource allocations to a number of significant airworthiness areas.\nCommand, Control and Communication\n\u0026#149;  The BOI identified a number of areas for improvements in the Command, Control and Communications during its examination and made 37 recommendations in this area that range from the command and control arrangements for flights and detachments to the overall management of Aviation within Navy.\nEngineering and Logistics\n\u0026#149;  26 recommendations for improvements in Engineering and Logistics areas were identified by the BOI. Improved crashworthy seats are being installed along with improvements to Sea King fuel systems. Support documentation is being reviewed and deficiencies corrected.\nGeneral Administration and Personnel\nThe BOI made 45 recommendations after examining areas of general administration and personnel support, including support to survivors and families of deceased ADF personnel.\nMaintenance Management\n\u0026#149;  Deficiencies in maintenance management were a significant contributing factor to the accident and the BOI made 13 recommendations to address the identified problems. Navy initiated a Maintenance Reinvigoration Program in 2005 that has already achieved 68 of the 72 action items targeted for improvement. These include enhancements to improve maintenance safety and culture, and altering squadron maintenance structures to ensure appropriate levels of supervision. A program has also been established to educate staff about human factors in maintenance and correct maintenance practice.\nOperations\n\u0026#149;  There are 45 recommendations for better management of ADF operations. Recommendations include: the management of cargo during contingency operations such as humanitarian aid flights; the need for greater intellectual rigour in managing risks during highly dynamic operations; and improvements to communications procedures and systems when operating in remote areas.\nSafety and Safety Management\n\u0026#149;  There are 14 recommendations to address Safety and Safety Management issues. Defence has already implemented significant improvements to its safety management systems since this accident occurred. Navy has already introduced improved safety climate and culture surveys in Navy aviation squadrons, improvement to personal protection equipment is being examined, and better systems to audit safety trends and communicate operational hazards are being developed.\nAviation Training and Skills\n\u0026#149;  There are 40 recommendations to improve Aviation Training and Skills of personnel ranging from junior sailors to senior officers involved in aviation management. Recommendations include education and competency improvement programs, and continuation training programs at the aviation squadrons.\n \nDocumentation\nSea King Board of Inquiry - Recommendations Complete \nAbbreviations and Terms for the Implementation Plan \nSea King Board of Inquiry -

To ensure these changes are implemented, the Chief of the Defence Force (CDF) has directed that the following five step strategy be adopted;\n1.      A specialist Implementation Team headed by a Senior Officer has been established to ensure adequate governance and that the recommendations are properly implemented.\n2.      The Implementation Team will develop implementation strategies for each recommendation including milestones for achievement and measures of success.\n3 To ensure the highest level of oversight, the CDF has directed that this Implementation Team report to the Chiefs of Service Committee, the most senior management group in ADF quarterly.\n4.      Defence will continue the policy of openness and transparency that it has maintained throughout the BOI period, by providing routine public updates on its progress in implementing the Report's recommendations.  Additionally, achievements against the recommendations will be detailed in future Defence Annual Reports.\n5.      In order to ensure the survivors and families of the victims are kept fully informed of our progress in implementing the recommendations, CDF has directed the Implementation Team offer to brief them on a quarterly basis.\nRecommendation themes\nDefence has accepted all 256 recommendations of the report which can be broadly grouped into the following eight themes:\nAirworthiness\n\u0026#149;  There are 35 recommendations to improve the ADF Airworthiness system. Significantly the Chief of Air Force, as the ADF Airworthiness Authority, has initiated a strategic review of the ADF Airworthiness Management System that will consider the structure of the organisation that manages airworthiness, the effectiveness of current airworthiness processes and the adequacy of resource allocations to a number of significant airworthiness areas.\nCommand, Control and Communication\n\u0026#149;  The BOI identified a number of areas for improvements in the Command, Control and Communications during its examination and made 37 recommendations in this area that range from the command and control arrangements for flights and detachments to the overall management of Aviation within Navy.\nEngineering and Logistics\n\u0026#149;  26 recommendations for improvements in Engineering and Logistics areas were identified by the BOI. Improved crashworthy seats are being installed along with improvements to Sea King fuel systems. Support documentation is being reviewed and deficiencies corrected.\nGeneral Administration and Personnel\nThe BOI made 45 recommendations after examining areas of general administration and personnel support, including support to survivors and families of deceased ADF personnel.\nMaintenance Management\n\u0026#149;  Deficiencies in maintenance management were a significant contributing factor to the accident and the BOI made 13 recommendations to address the identified problems. Navy initiated a Maintenance Reinvigoration Program in 2005 that has already achieved 68 of the 72 action items targeted for improvement. These include enhancements to improve maintenance safety and culture, and altering squadron maintenance structures to ensure appropriate levels of supervision. A program has also been established to educate staff about human factors in maintenance and correct maintenance practice.\nOperations\n\u0026#149;  There are 45 recommendations for better management of ADF operations. Recommendations include: the management of cargo during contingency operations such as humanitarian aid flights; the need for greater intellectual rigour in managing risks during highly dynamic operations; and improvements to communications procedures and systems when operating in remote areas.\nSafety and Safety Management\n\u0026#149;  There are 14 recommendations to address Safety and Safety Management issues. Defence has already implemented significant improvements to its safety management systems since this accident occurred. Navy has already introduced improved safety climate and culture surveys in Navy aviation squadrons, improvement to personal protection equipment is being examined, and better systems to audit safety trends and communicate operational hazards are being developed.\nAviation Training and Skills\n\u0026#149;  There are 40 recommendations to improve Aviation Training and Skills of personnel ranging from junior sailors to senior officers involved in aviation management. Recommendations include education and competency improvement programs, and continuation training programs at the aviation squadrons.\n \nDocumentation\nSea King Board of Inquiry - Recommendations

The Government will invest around 17 per cent of Defence capital expenditure in our strike and air combat capabilities to 2025‐26. More potent strike capabilities will provide flexibility for the Australian Defence Force (ADF) to rapidly respond to threats against Australia and provide military contributions to support regional security and coalition operations globally, where our interests are engaged.\nThe ADF will be equipped with a potent and technologically advanced air combat and strike capability, building on the current fleet of 24 F/A‐18F Super Hornets, 71 F/A‐18A/B Classic Hornets, and six E‐7A Wedgetail airborne early warning and control aircraft.\nKey Strike and Air Combat capabilities\nThe Government will ensure that the ADF has the most capable weapons to fulfil its strike and air combat missions in the future. A series of new air‐to‐surface, air‐to‐air and high‐speed and long‐range strike and anti‐ship weapons will be acquired for the strike and air combat capability.\nThe ADF’s integrated air and missile defence system will also be enhanced to improve the accuracy and speed of ADF systems’ response to air and missile threats, and to integrate and share air and space surveillance information more effectively. The Government will increase investment in capabilities to better connect the communications, sensor and targeting systems of various platforms so that they can more effectively combine their capabilities, generating greater potency and lethality. The ADF’s enhanced integrated air and missile defence capabilities will have the flexibility for further enhancement to handle more complex threats that may emerge in the future.\nDefence will also acquire ground‐based active electronically scanned array radars from around 2020 and expand Australia’s access to air and space situational awareness information, including through space‐based systems.\nThe Government will also introduce a more sophisticated ground‐based air defence system to replace the short‐range RBS‐70 missile system. A new man‐portable short‐range system will be introduced by the early 2020s, and will be supplemented by an advanced tactical and medium‐range surface‐to‐air missile system in the mid to late 2020s, providing layered air‐defence against a broad range of capable air threats.\nThe 72 fifth generation F‐35A Lightning II Joint Strike Fighters will enter service from 2020 to replace the F/A‐18A/B Classic Hornets. The Joint Strike Fighters will use a mix of air‐to‐air and air‐to‐surface weapons, operate at extended range, maintaining stealth, providing a true multi‐role capability. The 24 F/A‐18F Super Hornets will complement the Joint Strike Fighter aircraft. The Super Hornets will be able to strike potential adversary targets, control the air, and enable ADF or coalition maritime or land operations to proceed unhindered. After 2020, the Government will consider options to replace the Super Hornets in around 2030.\nThe 12 E/A‐18G Growler electronic attack aircraft will enter service from 2018. The aircraft will provide a unique capability to disrupt, disable or confuse adversaries’ electronic systems such as radars and communications systems. The six in‐service E‐7A Wedgetail airborne early warning and control aircraft will continue to be upgraded in order to maintain their capability edge to the mid 2030s.\nPeople\nApproximately, an additional 500 ADF positions will be allocated to 2025‐26 to support the introduction of more potent strike and air combat capabilities.\nInfrastructure\nThe Government will make a significant investment in new infrastructure and facilities to 2025‐26 to support the ADF’s strike and air combat capabilities. This will include upgrades to facilities at Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) bases Darwin and Tindal, Northern Territory; RAAF bases Amberley, Townsville and Scherger, Queensland; RAAF Williamtown, New South Wales; RAAF Edinburgh, South Australia; and RAAF bases Pearce, Learmonth and Curtin in Western Australia.\nDefence Service \u0026 Personnel Records\nFreedom of Information\nInformation Publication Scheme\nPopular publications\nAnnual reports\nBudget\nDefence White Paper\nFOI Disclosures\nInquiry Reports\nPay \u0026 Conditions Manual\nPublications\nIn focus\nPathway to Change\nFighting Fit - ADF Health Portal\nAnzac Centenary\nAnzac Day\nFirst Principles Review\nReport Abuse and Misconduct\nSeMPRO : Victim focused\nFamily and Domestic Violence\nLike the website?\nWe welcome you to take our 20 second survey and help us improve the site.\n \nFeedback\n \nMinister for Defence\nHome page\nBiography\nMedia releases\nSpeeches\nTranscripts\nDefence Service \u0026 Personnel Records\nFreedom of Information\nInformation Publication Scheme\nPopular publications\nAnnual reports\nBudget\nDefence White Paper\nFOI Disclosures\nInquiry Reports\nPay \u0026 Conditions Manual\nPublications\nIn focus\nPathway to Change\nFighting Fit - ADF Health Portal\nAnzac Centenary\nAnzac Day\nFirst Principles Review\nReport Abuse and Misconduct\nSeMPRO : Victim focused\nFamily and Domestic Violence\nLike the website?\nWe welcome you to take our 20 second survey and help us improve the site.\n \nFeedback\n \nMinister for Defence\nHome page\nBiography\nMedia releases\nSpeeches\nTranscripts\nDefending Australia and its National Interests\nContact us\nCopyright\nDisclaimer\nPrivacy\nAccessibility\nSitemap\nError/bug\nToggle responsive view\nBack to top\n","title":"   \t  Strike and Air Combat : At a Glance       : Department of Defence","url":"http://defence.gov.au/Whitepaper/AtAGlance/Strike-Air-Combat.asp","version":1},"task":{"breadth":0,"created":"2018-09-27T21:43:56.016775231Z","depth":0,"host":"defence.gov.au","id":"bemku70t87468b6omfrg","last_check":"2018-09-27T21:46:16.184457373Z","last_fetch":"2018-09-27T21:46:15.94872182Z","next_check":"2018-09-27T21:56:16.184457373Z","original_url":"http://defence.gov.au/Whitepaper/AtAGlance/Strike-Air-Combat.asp","reference_url":"http://defence.gov.au/WhitePaper/","schema":"http","snapshot_created":"2018-09-27T21:46:15.948696287Z","snapshot_hash":"7ccaa780df0ec6779d42a5ed53145ec4f013101d","snapshot_id":"bemkv9ot8746bdj87u2g","snapshot_version":1,"status":3,"updated":"2018-09-27T21:46:15.937211379Z","url":"http://defence.gov.au/Whitepaper/AtAGlance/Strike-Air-Combat.asp"}},"fields":{"snapshot.title.keyword":["   \t  Strike and Air Combat : At a Glance       : Department of Defence"]},"highlight":{"snapshot.title":["Strike and <span class=highlight_snippet >Air</span> Combat : At a Glance       : Department of Defence"],"snapshot.text":["Panel & Community Consultation\nPublic Submissions\nContact Us\nStrike and <span class=highlight_snippet >Air</span> Combat\nStrike and <span class=highlight_snippet >Air</span> Combat\n[\nPDF 120KB]\nThe Integrated Investment Program","Key Strike and <span class=highlight_snippet >Air</span> Combat capabilities\nThe Government will ensure that the ADF has the most capable weapons to fulfil its strike and <span class=highlight_snippet >air</span> combat missions","A series of new <span class=highlight_snippet >air</span>‐to‐surface, <span class=highlight_snippet >air</span>‐to‐<span class=highlight_snippet >air</span> and high‐speed and long‐range strike and anti‐ship weapons will be acquired for the strike and <span class=highlight_snippet >air</span> combat capability","missile system in the mid to late 2020s, providing layered <span class=highlight_snippet >air</span>‐defence against a broad range of capable <span class=highlight_snippet >air</span> threats.","The Joint Strike Fighters will use a mix of <span class=highlight_snippet >air</span>‐to‐<span class=highlight_snippet >air</span> and <span class=highlight_snippet >air</span>‐to‐surface weapons, operate at extended range, maintaining stealth, providing a true multi‐role"]},"inner_hits":{"collpased_docs":{"hits":{"total":1,"max_score":4.9197817,"hits":[{"_index":"gopa-index","_type":"doc","_id":"08307224bdadea2160b25f6430b50592","_score":4.9197817,"_source":{"host":"defence.gov.au","snapshot":{"content_type":"text/html","created":"2018-09-27T21:46:15.948696287Z","description":"\nAt a glance.

The ADF’s enhanced integrated air and missile defence capabilities will have the flexibility for further enhancement to handle more complex threats that may emerge in the future.\nDefence will also acquire ground‐based active electronically scanned array radars from around 2020 and expand Australia’s access to air and space situational awareness information, including through space‐based systems.\nThe Government will also introduce a more sophisticated ground‐based air defence system to replace the short‐range RBS‐70 missile system. A new man‐portable short‐range system will be introduced by the early 2020s, and will be supplemented by an advanced tactical and medium‐range surface‐to‐air missile system in the mid to late 2020s, providing layered air‐defence against a broad range of capable air threats.\nThe 72 fifth generation F‐35A Lightning II Joint Strike Fighters will enter service from 2020 to replace the F/A‐18A/B Classic Hornets. The Joint Strike Fighters will use a mix of air‐to‐air and air‐to‐surface weapons, operate at extended range, maintaining stealth, providing a true multi‐role capability. The 24 F/A‐18F Super Hornets will complement the Joint Strike Fighter aircraft. The Super Hornets will be able to strike potential adversary targets, control the air, and enable ADF or coalition maritime or land operations to proceed unhindered. After 2020, the Government will consider options to replace the Super Hornets in around 2030.\nThe 12 E/A‐18G Growler electronic attack aircraft will enter service from 2018. The aircraft will provide a unique capability to disrupt, disable or confuse adversaries’ electronic systems such as radars and communications systems. The six in‐service E‐7A Wedgetail airborne early warning and control aircraft will continue to be upgraded in order to maintain their capability edge to the mid 2030s.\nPeople\nApproximately, an additional 500 ADF positions will be allocated to 2025‐26 to support the introduction of more potent strike and air combat capabilities.\nInfrastructure\nThe Government will make a significant investment in new infrastructure and facilities to 2025‐26 to support the ADF’s strike and air combat capabilities. This will include upgrades to facilities at Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) bases Darwin and Tindal, Northern Territory; RAAF bases Amberley, Townsville and Scherger, Queensland; RAAF Williamtown, New South Wales; RAAF Edinburgh, South Australia; and RAAF bases Pearce, Learmonth and Curtin in Western Australia.\nDefence Service \u0026 Personnel Records\nFreedom of Information\nInformation Publication Scheme\nPopular publications\nAnnual reports\nBudget\nDefence White Paper\nFOI Disclosures\nInquiry Reports\nPay \u0026 Conditions Manual\nPublications\nIn focus\nPathway to Change\nFighting Fit - ADF Health Portal\nAnzac Centenary\nAnzac Day\nFirst Principles Review\nReport Abuse and Misconduct\nSeMPRO : Victim focused\nFamily and Domestic Violence\nLike the website?\nWe welcome you to take our 20 second survey and help us improve the site.\n \nFeedback\n \nMinister for Defence\nHome page\nBiography\nMedia releases\nSpeeches\nTranscripts\nDefence Service \u0026 Personnel Records\nFreedom of Information\nInformation Publication Scheme\nPopular publications\nAnnual reports\nBudget\nDefence White Paper\nFOI Disclosures\nInquiry Reports\nPay \u0026 Conditions Manual\nPublications\nIn focus\nPathway to Change\nFighting Fit - ADF Health Portal\nAnzac Centenary\nAnzac Day\nFirst Principles Review\nReport Abuse and Misconduct\nSeMPRO : Victim focused\nFamily and Domestic Violence\nLike the website?\nWe welcome you to take our 20 second survey and help us improve the site.\n \nFeedback\n \nMinister for Defence\nHome page\nBiography\nMedia releases\nSpeeches\nTranscripts\nDefending Australia and its National Interests\nContact us\nCopyright\nDisclaimer\nPrivacy\nAccessibility\nSitemap\nError/bug\nToggle responsive view\nBack to top\n","title":"   \t  Strike and Air Combat : At a Glance       : Department of Defence","url":"http://defence.gov.au/Whitepaper/AtAGlance/Strike-Air-Combat.asp","version":1},"task":{"breadth":0,"created":"2018-09-27T21:43:56.016775231Z","depth":0,"host":"defence.gov.au","id":"bemku70t87468b6omfrg","last_check":"2018-09-27T21:46:16.184457373Z","last_fetch":"2018-09-27T21:46:15.94872182Z","next_check":"2018-09-27T21:56:16.184457373Z","original_url":"http://defence.gov.au/Whitepaper/AtAGlance/Strike-Air-Combat.asp","reference_url":"http://defence.gov.au/WhitePaper/","schema":"http","snapshot_created":"2018-09-27T21:46:15.948696287Z","snapshot_hash":"7ccaa780df0ec6779d42a5ed53145ec4f013101d","snapshot_id":"bemkv9ot8746bdj87u2g","snapshot_version":1,"status":3,"updated":"2018-09-27T21:46:15.937211379Z","url":"http://defence.gov.au/Whitepaper/AtAGlance/Strike-Air-Combat.asp"}}}]}}}},{"_index":"gopa-index","_type":"doc","_id":"b4a0359906cadaae1cd8f4ab17d67960","_score":4.06874,"_source":{"host":"defence.gov.au","snapshot":{"content_type":"text/html","created":"2018-09-27T21:44:01.684683776Z","description":" \n\n\t\tDepartment of Defence.

The Government will invest around six per cent of Defence capability expenditure to 2025‐26 in our air and sea lift capabilities. Given the substantial distances over which the Australian Defence Force (ADF) must operate – nationally, regionally and globally – air and sea lift capabilities are essential. A flexible force of air and sea lift capabilities will enable the ADF to reach, resupply and sustain missions in different locations. The ADF also needs to have lift capacity to be highly mobile within any area of operation.\nKey air and sea lift capabilities\nThe ADF’s strategic transport capability will be greatly enhanced through the already delivered acquisition of two additional heavy‐lift C‐17A Globemaster transport aircraft, capable of moving large cargo and numbers of personnel great distances, such as from Australia to the Middle East, increasing our fleet to eight aircraft. Additional heavy lift aircraft will be considered at a later stage.\nThe Government will extend the range of combat and surveillance aircraft, acquiring two additional KC‐30A air‐to‐air refuellers before the end of this decade for a total of seven aircraft. Expanding the fleet to nine aircraft in the longer term will be considered to meet increasing demand.\nOur Chinook helicopters are a workhorse of the ADF, capable of moving stores and personnel, including vehicles and artillery around the battlefield or from ships to the land without the need for an airfield as well as undertaking aero‐medical evacuation. The Government will acquire three additional CH‐47F Chinook heavy‐lift helicopters in the near term to expand battlefield lift capacity and support tactical missions including aero‐medical evacuation for a total of 10 helicopters.\nThe logistics support ship, HMAS Choules, and the two Canberra Class amphibious ships, will provide scalable and flexible options for greater capacity sea lift and amphibious operations. The Government will extend the life of HMAS Choules and update the capabilities onboard, including modern self defence and aviation support systems until it is replaced around 2030.\nIn addition, the Government will acquire a new large hulled multi‐purpose patrol vessel, the Australian Defence Vessel Ocean Protector for the Navy to support border protection and maritime resource security related tasks with the Australian Border Force.\nSustainment of our maritime capabilities will be improved by two new replenishment vessels that will begin service by 2026. The vessels will provide naval combat units with fuel, water and stores while underway at sea. A third replenishment vessel or additional logistics support ship will be acquired the late 2020s.\nTogether, HMAS\nChoules\n, the amphibious ships, and replenishment vessels, will enable the ADF to conduct a greater number of challenging maritime operations at the same time, and to sustain those operations for longer periods than we can today.\nThe Government will acquire enhanced aero‐medical evacuation and search and rescue capabilities for our forces, with upgrades to aero‐medical equipment for the Chinook helicopters commencing from 2016. In the longer term, options will be investigated for a dedicated long‐range combat search and rescue capability.\nThe Government will upgrade the 12 C‐130J Hercules medium transport aircraft to ensure that they can continue to fulfil their critical role in moving stores and equipment within our region when required.\n10 C‐27J Spartan medium transport aircraft are currently being introduced into service. The Spartans will enhance the ADF’s air lift capability, providing a unique capacity to move personnel and small cargos to remote locations using shorter landing strips not suitable for any other fixed wing military aircraft in the ADF fleet.\nThe MRH‐90 Troop lift helicopter will continue to be introduced into service, with Army to operate 39 to 41 aircraft and Navy to operate up to eight aircraft. The aircraft will be a force multiplier for Army in tactical air mobility and for Navy in maritime support.

The Government will invest around six per cent of Defence capability expenditure to 2025‐26 in our air and sea lift capabilities. Given the substantial distances over which the Australian Defence Force (ADF) must operate – nationally, regionally and globally – air and sea lift capabilities are essential. A flexible force of air and sea lift capabilities will enable the ADF to reach, resupply and sustain missions in different locations. The ADF also needs to have lift capacity to be highly mobile within any area of operation.\nKey air and sea lift capabilities\nThe ADF’s strategic transport capability will be greatly enhanced through the already delivered acquisition of two additional heavy‐lift C‐17A Globemaster transport aircraft, capable of moving large cargo and numbers of personnel great distances, such as from Australia to the Middle East, increasing our fleet to eight aircraft. Additional heavy lift aircraft will be considered at a later stage.\nThe Government will extend the range of combat and surveillance aircraft, acquiring two additional KC‐30A air‐to‐air refuellers before the end of this decade for a total of seven aircraft. Expanding the fleet to nine aircraft in the longer term will be considered to meet increasing demand.\nOur Chinook helicopters are a workhorse of the ADF, capable of moving stores and personnel, including vehicles and artillery around the battlefield or from ships to the land without the need for an airfield as well as undertaking aero‐medical evacuation. The Government will acquire three additional CH‐47F Chinook heavy‐lift helicopters in the near term to expand battlefield lift capacity and support tactical missions including aero‐medical evacuation for a total of 10 helicopters.\nThe logistics support ship, HMAS Choules, and the two Canberra Class amphibious ships, will provide scalable and flexible options for greater capacity sea lift and amphibious operations. The Government will extend the life of HMAS Choules and update the capabilities onboard, including modern self defence and aviation support systems until it is replaced around 2030.\nIn addition, the Government will acquire a new large hulled multi‐purpose patrol vessel, the Australian Defence Vessel Ocean Protector for the Navy to support border protection and maritime resource security related tasks with the Australian Border Force.\nSustainment of our maritime capabilities will be improved by two new replenishment vessels that will begin service by 2026. The vessels will provide naval combat units with fuel, water and stores while underway at sea. A third replenishment vessel or additional logistics support ship will be acquired the late 2020s.\nTogether, HMAS\nChoules\n, the amphibious ships, and replenishment vessels, will enable the ADF to conduct a greater number of challenging maritime operations at the same time, and to sustain those operations for longer periods than we can today.\nThe Government will acquire enhanced aero‐medical evacuation and search and rescue capabilities for our forces, with upgrades to aero‐medical equipment for the Chinook helicopters commencing from 2016. In the longer term, options will be investigated for a dedicated long‐range combat search and rescue capability.\nThe Government will upgrade the 12 C‐130J Hercules medium transport aircraft to ensure that they can continue to fulfil their critical role in moving stores and equipment within our region when required.\n10 C‐27J Spartan medium transport aircraft are currently being introduced into service. The Spartans will enhance the ADF’s air lift capability, providing a unique capacity to move personnel and small cargos to remote locations using shorter landing strips not suitable for any other fixed wing military aircraft in the ADF fleet.\nThe MRH‐90 Troop lift helicopter will continue to be introduced into service, with Army to operate 39 to 41 aircraft and Navy to operate up to eight aircraft. The aircraft will be a force multiplier for Army in tactical air mobility and for Navy in maritime support. Current plans include a requirement for role‐specific upgrades to the MRH‐90 Troop lift helicopter to replace the S‐70A Blackhawk in support of domestic counter terrorism operations.\nPeople\nAn additional around 800 ADF positions will be allocated to 2025‐26 to assist with the air and sea lift fleets, including introduction of the two additional heavy lift C‐17A Globemaster transport aircraft, two additional air‐to‐air refuelling aircraft, 10 C‐27J Spartan medium transport aircraft, two new replenishment vessels, and three additional CH‐47 Chinook heavy‐lift helicopters.\nInfrastructure\nSubstantial investment in support of air lift is programmed for upgraded infrastructure at RAAF Base Amberley, Queensland, including facilities to support an increased number of tactical, medium and strategic lift aircraft.

Review\u0026rsquo;s final report\nwas released by the\nMinister for Defence Stephen Smith on 3 May 2012.\nBackground\nOn 22 June 2011 Minister for Defence Stephen Smith announced a\nForce Posture\nReview\nto assess whether the Australian Defence Force (ADF) is correctly\ngeographically positioned to meet Australia\u0026rsquo;s current and future strategic\nchallenges.\nThe Department of Defence undertook the Review with oversight by an expert\npanel made up of two renowned Australian national security specialists: Dr Allan\nHawke and Mr Ric Smith.\nFinal Report\nThe Review\u0026rsquo;s final report\nwas submitted to the Government on 30 March 2012.\nThe findings of the Review will inform development of the 2014 Defence White\nPaper. While the Review outlines a range of options for Government\nconsideration, no decisions will be made on these options until they have been\nconsidered as part of the White Paper development process.\nScope of the Review\nThe Review builds on the strategic and capability judgements contained in the\n2009 Defence White Paper 2009. It considers the force posture implications of\nthe range of present and emerging global, regional and national strategic and\nsecurity factors which require careful consideration for the future, including:\nthe rise of the Asia-Pacific as a region of global strategic significance;\nthe rise of the Indian Ocean rim as a region of global strategic\nsignificance;\nthe growth of military power projection capabilities of countries in the Asia\nPacific;\nthe growing need for the provision of humanitarian assistance and disaster\nrelief following extreme events in the Asia Pacific region; and\nenergy security and security issues associated with expanding offshore\nresource exploitation in our North West and Northern approaches.\nThe Review was informed by Defence\u0026rsquo;s assessment of basing requirements and\nthe possible resulting changes to Defence\u0026rsquo;s estate over the next 25 years. It\napplied the strategic basing principles set out in chapter 15 of the 2009\nDefence White Paper.\nWhile the Review focused on ADF requirements, its findings complement the\nwork underway with the United States on its Global Force Posture Review\ninitiatives involving Australia.\nPublic submissions\nPublic submissions to the Review can be accessed\nhere\nContact details\nEmail

Posture\nReview\nto assess whether the Australian Defence Force (ADF) is correctly\ngeographically positioned to meet Australia\u0026rsquo;s current and future strategic\nchallenges.\nThe Department of Defence undertook the Review with oversight by an expert\npanel made up of two renowned Australian national security specialists: Dr Allan\nHawke and Mr Ric Smith.\nFinal Report\nThe Review\u0026rsquo;s final report\nwas submitted to the Government on 30 March 2012.\nThe findings of the Review will inform development of the 2014 Defence White\nPaper.

The team is helping ANASMA improve the strength of their institution, by supporting them in developing better institutional relationships with other training establishments and advising them on growing their capacity and capability.\nThe Australian Defence Force has led the advisory team at ANASMA since 2017, as part of Operation Highroad, the name given to Australia’s contribution to the NATO-led mission in Afghanistan.\nNew\nAbseiling adventure training on Exercise Pandaroo\n20 Sep 2018\nTen soldiers from the People’s Liberation Army – China, and ten soldiers from the Australian Army are taking part in Exercise Pandaroo 2018, taking place in the Blue Mountains and Sydney regions from 18-28 September 2018.
