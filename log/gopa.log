The Government will invest around 17 per cent of Defence capital expenditure in our strike and air combat capabilities to 2025â26. More potent strike capabilities will provide flexibility for the Australian Defence Force (ADF) to rapidly respond to threats against Australia and provide military contributions to support regional security and coalition operations globally, where our interests are engaged.\nThe ADF will be equipped with a potent and technologically advanced air combat and strike capability, building on the current fleet of 24 F/Aâ18F Super Hornets, 71 F/Aâ18A/B Classic Hornets, and six Eâ7A Wedgetail airborne early warning and control aircraft.\nKey Strike and Air Combat capabilities\nThe Government will ensure that the ADF has the most capable weapons to fulfil its strike and air combat missions in the future. A series of new airâtoâsurface, airâtoâair and highâspeed and longârange strike and antiâship weapons will be acquired for the strike and air combat capability.\nThe ADFâs integrated air and missile defence system will also be enhanced to improve the accuracy and speed of ADF systemsâ response to air and missile threats, and to integrate and share air and space surveillance information more effectively. The Government will increase investment in capabilities to better connect the communications, sensor and targeting systems of various platforms so that they can more effectively combine their capabilities, generating greater potency and lethality. The ADFâs enhanced integrated air and missile defence capabilities will have the flexibility for further enhancement to handle more complex threats that may emerge in the future.\nDefence will also acquire groundâbased active electronically scanned array radars from around 2020 and expand Australiaâs access to air and space situational awareness information, including through spaceâbased systems.\nThe Government will also introduce a more sophisticated groundâbased air defence system to replace the shortârange RBSâ70 missile system. A new manâportable shortârange system will be introduced by the early 2020s, and will be supplemented by an advanced tactical and mediumârange surfaceâtoâair missile system in the mid to late 2020s, providing layered airâdefence against a broad range of capable air threats.\nThe 72 fifth generation Fâ35A Lightning II Joint Strike Fighters will enter service from 2020 to replace the F/Aâ18A/B Classic Hornets. The Joint Strike Fighters will use a mix of airâtoâair and airâtoâsurface weapons, operate at extended range, maintaining stealth, providing a true multiârole capability. The 24 F/Aâ18F Super Hornets will complement the Joint Strike Fighter aircraft. The Super Hornets will be able to strike potential adversary targets, control the air, and enable ADF or coalition maritime or land operations to proceed unhindered. After 2020, the Government will consider options to replace the Super Hornets in around 2030.\nThe 12 E/Aâ18G Growler electronic attack aircraft will enter service from 2018. The aircraft will provide a unique capability to disrupt, disable or confuse adversariesâ electronic systems such as radars and communications systems. The six inâservice Eâ7A Wedgetail airborne early warning and control aircraft will continue to be upgraded in order to maintain their capability edge to the mid 2030s.\nPeople\nApproximately, an additional 500 ADF positions will be allocated to 2025â26 to support the introduction of more potent strike and air combat capabilities.\nInfrastructure\nThe Government will make a significant investment in new infrastructure and facilities to 2025â26 to support the ADFâs strike and air combat capabilities. This will include upgrades to facilities at Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) bases Darwin and Tindal, Northern Territory; RAAF bases Amberley, Townsville and Scherger, Queensland; RAAF Williamtown, New South Wales; RAAF Edinburgh, South Australia; and RAAF bases Pearce, Learmonth and Curtin in Western Australia.\nDefence Service \u0026 Personnel Records\nFreedom of Information\nInformation Publication Scheme\nPopular publications\nAnnual reports\nBudget\nDefence White Paper\nFOI Disclosures\nInquiry Reports\nPay \u0026 Conditions Manual\nPublications\nIn focus\nPathway to Change\nFighting Fit - ADF Health Portal\nAnzac Centenary\nAnzac Day\nFirst Principles Review\nReport Abuse and Misconduct\nSeMPRO : Victim focused\nFamily and Domestic Violence\nLike the website?\nWe welcome you to take our 20 second survey and help us improve the site.\n \nFeedback\n \nMinister for Defence\nHome page\nBiography\nMedia releases\nSpeeches\nTranscripts\nDefence Service \u0026 Personnel Records\nFreedom of Information\nInformation Publication Scheme\nPopular publications\nAnnual reports\nBudget\nDefence White Paper\nFOI Disclosures\nInquiry Reports\nPay \u0026 Conditions Manual\nPublications\nIn focus\nPathway to Change\nFighting Fit - ADF Health Portal\nAnzac Centenary\nAnzac Day\nFirst Principles Review\nReport Abuse and Misconduct\nSeMPRO : Victim focused\nFamily and Domestic Violence\nLike the website?\nWe welcome you to take our 20 second survey and help us improve the site.\n \nFeedback\n \nMinister for Defence\nHome page\nBiography\nMedia releases\nSpeeches\nTranscripts\nDefending Australia and its National Interests\nContact us\nCopyright\nDisclaimer\nPrivacy\nAccessibility\nSitemap\nError/bug\nToggle responsive view\nBack to top\n","title":"   \t  Strike and Air Combat : At a Glance       : Department of Defence","url":"http://defence.gov.au/Whitepaper/AtAGlance/Strike-Air-Combat.asp","version":1},"task":{"breadth":0,"created":"2018-09-27T21:43:56.016775231Z","depth":0,"host":"defence.gov.au","id":"bemku70t87468b6omfrg","last_check":"2018-09-27T21:46:16.184457373Z","last_fetch":"2018-09-27T21:46:15.94872182Z","next_check":"2018-09-27T21:56:16.184457373Z","original_url":"http://defence.gov.au/Whitepaper/AtAGlance/Strike-Air-Combat.asp","reference_url":"http://defence.gov.au/WhitePaper/","schema":"http","snapshot_created":"2018-09-27T21:46:15.948696287Z","snapshot_hash":"7ccaa780df0ec6779d42a5ed53145ec4f013101d","snapshot_id":"bemkv9ot8746bdj87u2g","snapshot_version":1,"status":3,"updated":"2018-09-27T21:46:15.937211379Z","url":"http://defence.gov.au/Whitepaper/AtAGlance/Strike-Air-Combat.asp"}},"fields":{"snapshot.title.keyword":["   \t  Strike and Air Combat : At a Glance       : Department of Defence"]},"inner_hits":{"collpased_docs":{"hits":{"total":1,"max_score":2.0326936,"hits":[{"_index":"gopa-index","_type":"doc","_id":"08307224bdadea2160b25f6430b50592","_score":2.0326936,"_source":{"host":"defence.gov.au","snapshot":{"content_type":"text/html","created":"2018-09-27T21:46:15.948696287Z","description":"\nAt a glance.

The Government will invest around six per cent of Defence capability expenditure to 2025â26 in our air and sea lift capabilities. Given the substantial distances over which the Australian Defence Force (ADF) must operate â nationally, regionally and globally â air and sea lift capabilities are essential. A flexible force of air and sea lift capabilities will enable the ADF to reach, resupply and sustain missions in different locations. The ADF also needs to have lift capacity to be highly mobile within any area of operation.\nKey air and sea lift capabilities\nThe ADFâs strategic transport capability will be greatly enhanced through the already delivered acquisition of two additional heavyâlift Câ17A Globemaster transport aircraft, capable of moving large cargo and numbers of personnel great distances, such as from Australia to the Middle East, increasing our fleet to eight aircraft. Additional heavy lift aircraft will be considered at a later stage.\nThe Government will extend the range of combat and surveillance aircraft, acquiring two additional KCâ30A airâtoâair refuellers before the end of this decade for a total of seven aircraft. Expanding the fleet to nine aircraft in the longer term will be considered to meet increasing demand.\nOur Chinook helicopters are a workhorse of the ADF, capable of moving stores and personnel, including vehicles and artillery around the battlefield or from ships to the land without the need for an airfield as well as undertaking aeroâmedical evacuation. The Government will acquire three additional CHâ47F Chinook heavyâlift helicopters in the near term to expand battlefield lift capacity and support tactical missions including aeroâmedical evacuation for a total of 10 helicopters.\nThe logistics support ship, HMAS Choules, and the two Canberra Class amphibious ships, will provide scalable and flexible options for greater capacity sea lift and amphibious operations. The Government will extend the life of HMAS Choules and update the capabilities onboard, including modern self defence and aviation support systems until it is replaced around 2030.\nIn addition, the Government will acquire a new large hulled multiâpurpose patrol vessel, the Australian Defence Vessel Ocean Protector for the Navy to support border protection and maritime resource security related tasks with the Australian Border Force.\nSustainment of our maritime capabilities will be improved by two new replenishment vessels that will begin service by 2026. The vessels will provide naval combat units with fuel, water and stores while underway at sea. A third replenishment vessel or additional logistics support ship will be acquired the late 2020s.\nTogether, HMAS\nChoules\n, the amphibious ships, and replenishment vessels, will enable the ADF to conduct a greater number of challenging maritime operations at the same time, and to sustain those operations for longer periods than we can today.\nThe Government will acquire enhanced aeroâmedical evacuation and search and rescue capabilities for our forces, with upgrades to aeroâmedical equipment for the Chinook helicopters commencing from 2016. In the longer term, options will be investigated for a dedicated longârange combat search and rescue capability.\nThe Government will upgrade the 12 Câ130J Hercules medium transport aircraft to ensure that they can continue to fulfil their critical role in moving stores and equipment within our region when required.\n10 Câ27J Spartan medium transport aircraft are currently being introduced into service. The Spartans will enhance the ADFâs air lift capability, providing a unique capacity to move personnel and small cargos to remote locations using shorter landing strips not suitable for any other fixed wing military aircraft in the ADF fleet.\nThe MRHâ90 Troop lift helicopter will continue to be introduced into service, with Army to operate 39 to 41 aircraft and Navy to operate up to eight aircraft. The aircraft will be a force multiplier for Army in tactical air mobility and for Navy in maritime support. Current plans include a requirement for roleâspecific upgrades to the MRHâ90 Troop lift helicopter to replace the Sâ70A Blackhawk in support of domestic counter terrorism operations.\nPeople\nAn additional around 800 ADF positions will be allocated to 2025â26 to assist with the air and sea lift fleets, including introduction of the two additional heavy lift Câ17A Globemaster transport aircraft, two additional airâtoâair refuelling aircraft, 10 Câ27J Spartan medium transport aircraft, two new replenishment vessels, and three additional CHâ47 Chinook heavyâlift helicopters.\nInfrastructure\nSubstantial investment in support of air lift is programmed for upgraded infrastructure at RAAF Base Amberley, Queensland, including facilities to support an increased number of tactical, medium and strategic lift aircraft. Funding is also programmed at RAAF Base Richmond, New South Wales, in the latter years of the decade to 2025â26.\nAustraliaâs growing sea lift capability will be supported by planned upgrades to wharves and port facilities, including substantial investment in Fleet Base East, combined with continued commercial arrangements for ADF access to civilian infrastructure.\nDefence Service \u0026 Personnel Records\nFreedom of Information\nInformation Publication Scheme\nPopular publications\nAnnual reports\nBudget\nDefence White Paper\nFOI Disclosures\nInquiry Reports\nPay \u0026 Conditions Manual\nPublications\nIn focus\nPathway to Change\nFighting Fit - ADF Health Portal\nAnzac Centenary\nAnzac Day\nFirst Principles Review\nReport Abuse and Misconduct\nSeMPRO : Victim focused\nFamily and Domestic Violence\nLike the website?\nWe welcome you to take our 20 second survey and help us improve the site.\n \nFeedback\n \nMinister for Defence\nHome page\nBiography\nMedia releases\nSpeeches\nTranscripts\nDefence Service \u0026 Personnel Records\nFreedom of Information\nInformation Publication Scheme\nPopular publications\nAnnual reports\nBudget\nDefence White Paper\nFOI Disclosures\nInquiry Reports\nPay \u0026 Conditions Manual\nPublications\nIn focus\nPathway to Change\nFighting Fit - ADF Health Portal\nAnzac Centenary\nAnzac Day\nFirst Principles Review\nReport Abuse and Misconduct\nSeMPRO : Victim focused\nFamily and Domestic Violence\nLike the website?\nWe welcome you to take our 20 second survey and help us improve the site.\n \nFeedback\n \nMinister for Defence\nHome page\nBiography\nMedia releases\nSpeeches\nTranscripts\nDefending Australia and its National Interests\nContact us\nCopyright\nDisclaimer\nPrivacy\nAccessibility\nSitemap\nError/bug\nToggle responsive view\nBack to top\n","title":"   \t  Air and Sea Lift Capability : At a Glance       : Department of Defence","url":"http://defence.gov.au/Whitepaper/AtAGlance/Air-Sea-Lift.asp","version":1},"task":{"breadth":0,"created":"2018-09-27T21:43:55.533838966Z","depth":0,"host":"defence.gov.au","id":"bemku6ot87468b6omfag","last_check":"2018-09-27T21:46:14.820064928Z","last_fetch":"2018-09-27T21:46:14.642788256Z","next_check":"2018-09-27T21:56:14.820064928Z","original_url":"http://defence.gov.au/Whitepaper/AtAGlance/Air-Sea-Lift.asp","reference_url":"http://defence.gov.au/WhitePaper/","schema":"http","snapshot_created":"2018-09-27T21:46:14.642766527Z","snapshot_hash":"e51262c05664c75bd843b243e177eb7dc9fcc504","snapshot_id":"bemkv9gt8746bdj87o80","snapshot_version":1,"status":3,"updated":"2018-09-27T21:46:14.465695344Z","url":"http://defence.gov.au/Whitepaper/AtAGlance/Air-Sea-Lift.asp"}},"fields":{"snapshot.title.keyword":["   \t  Air and Sea Lift Capability : At a Glance       : Department of Defence"]},"inner_hits":{"collpased_docs":{"hits":{"total":1,"max_score":1.4586792,"hits":[{"_index":"gopa-index","_type":"doc","_id":"e561d8af12854a343b559cbc560eca3d","_score":1.4586792,"_source":{"host":"defence.gov.au","snapshot":{"content_type":"text/html","created":"2018-09-27T21:46:14.642766527Z","description":"\nAt a glance.

Funding is also programmed at RAAF Base Richmond, New South Wales, in the latter years of the decade to 2025â26.\nAustraliaâs growing sea lift capability will be supported by planned upgrades to wharves and port facilities, including substantial investment in Fleet Base East, combined with continued commercial arrangements for ADF access to civilian infrastructure.\nDefence Service \u0026 Personnel Records\nFreedom of Information\nInformation Publication Scheme\nPopular publications\nAnnual reports\nBudget\nDefence White Paper\nFOI Disclosures\nInquiry Reports\nPay \u0026 Conditions Manual\nPublications\nIn focus\nPathway to Change\nFighting Fit - ADF Health Portal\nAnzac Centenary\nAnzac Day\nFirst Principles Review\nReport Abuse and Misconduct\nSeMPRO : Victim focused\nFamily and Domestic Violence\nLike the website?\nWe welcome you to take our 20 second survey and help us improve the site.\n \nFeedback\n \nMinister for Defence\nHome page\nBiography\nMedia releases\nSpeeches\nTranscripts\nDefence Service \u0026 Personnel Records\nFreedom of Information\nInformation Publication Scheme\nPopular publications\nAnnual reports\nBudget\nDefence White Paper\nFOI Disclosures\nInquiry Reports\nPay \u0026 Conditions Manual\nPublications\nIn focus\nPathway to Change\nFighting Fit - ADF Health Portal\nAnzac Centenary\nAnzac Day\nFirst Principles Review\nReport Abuse and Misconduct\nSeMPRO : Victim focused\nFamily and Domestic Violence\nLike the website?\nWe welcome you to take our 20 second survey and help us improve the site.\n \nFeedback\n \nMinister for Defence\nHome page\nBiography\nMedia releases\nSpeeches\nTranscripts\nDefending Australia and its National Interests\nContact us\nCopyright\nDisclaimer\nPrivacy\nAccessibility\nSitemap\nError/bug\nToggle responsive view\nBack to top\n","title":"   \t  Air and Sea Lift Capability : At a Glance       : Department of Defence","url":"http://defence.gov.au/Whitepaper/AtAGlance/Air-Sea-Lift.asp","version":1},"task":{"breadth":0,"created":"2018-09-27T21:43:55.533838966Z","depth":0,"host":"defence.gov.au","id":"bemku6ot87468b6omfag","last_check":"2018-09-27T21:46:14.820064928Z","last_fetch":"2018-09-27T21:46:14.642788256Z","next_check":"2018-09-27T21:56:14.820064928Z","original_url":"http://defence.gov.au/Whitepaper/AtAGlance/Air-Sea-Lift.asp","reference_url":"http://defence.gov.au/WhitePaper/","schema":"http","snapshot_created":"2018-09-27T21:46:14.642766527Z","snapshot_hash":"e51262c05664c75bd843b243e177eb7dc9fcc504","snapshot_id":"bemkv9gt8746bdj87o80","snapshot_version":1,"status":3,"updated":"2018-09-27T21:46:14.465695344Z","url":"http://defence.gov.au/Whitepaper/AtAGlance/Air-Sea-Lift.asp"}}}]}}}},{"_index":"gopa-index","_type":"doc","_id":"e2edd4c2a6d14fd3a1088a57da104e74","_score":1.4586792,"_source":{"host":"defence.gov.au","snapshot":{"content_type":"text/html","created":"2018-09-27T21:46:14.757960453Z","description":"\nAt a glance.

The Defence Industry Policy Statement provides the foundation to take the partnerships between Defence and industry to new levels of cooperation, with a focus on stronger, more strategic\npartnerships and closer alignment between industry investment and Defence capability needs. Initiatives in the Defence Industry Policy Statement will see the development of a technologically advanced, innovationâdriven and sustainable Australian defence industrial base, which is well placed to assist Defence in protecting Australiaâs national interests.\nDelivering Defence Capability\nThe Governmentâs 10âyear Defence budget plan to 2025â26 grows the Defence budget from $32.4 billion in 2016â17 to $58.7 billion in 2025â26, providing an additional $29.9 billion to Defence over this period than previously planned. The Government will invest approximately $195 billion in Defence capability to 2025â26, restoring confidence in Defenceâs long term funding.\nFor the first time, the 2016 Integrated Investment Program released with the Defence White Paper brings together all elements of Defence investment, including equipment, facilities, workforce, and information and communications technology as well as major weapons, platforms and systems. Australian industry now has the clarity and certainty to invest in the people and infrastructure to make these capability plans a reality.\nThe 2016 Defence Industry Policy Statement, the First Principles Review and the Governmentâs decisions on naval shipbuilding, reinforce the importance of treating Australian industry as a fundamental input to capability. It will be mandatory for Defence to consider Australian industry in the formal capability development process. This will help industry to better match specialist skills and advances in science and technology to develop innovative solutions for new capabilities.\nStrategic Partnership with Industry\nThe Government places a high priority on maximising the innovation potential of the Australian economy. Innovation will be reâpositioned as an essential driver to generate new capabilities for Defence and new opportunities for Australian industry. The Governmentâs Defence Industry Policy Statement complements the 2015 National Innovation and Science Agenda, with a focus on maximising the delivery of Defence capability through a more focused, coordinated and transparent effort between Defence and industry. The Statement will transform Defenceâs approach to innovation, and create a seamless link between capability needs, smart ideas and innovation in Australian industry. New initiatives will harness Australiaâs potential for innovation by streamlining engagement with industry, academic and research organisations, and by establishing a single endâtoend\ninnovation pipeline with a clear path to commercialisation.\nHarnessing Australian Innovation in the Defence Sector\nThe Government is committed to maximising opportunities for competitive Australian businesses; building export potential, depth of skills and diversification for defence industry, and cutting red tape to make it simpler and less costly for Australian industry to support Defence.\nThe initiatives in this Statement will bring Defence and industry closer together and drive the changes we need to ensure industry becomes more competitive and highly skilled, and to encourage investment both at the local and international level.\nThe new Defence Industry Policy Statement centres on two key initiatives: the Centre for Defence Industry Capability and a new approach to Defence innovation. These initiatives will deliver around $1.6 billion in investment in Defenceârelated innovation to 2025â26, supporting Australian science and technology and innovation to provide advanced homeâgrown Defence capabilities.\nThe Centre for Defence Industry Capability will be funded at around $230 million to 2025â26. The Centre will promote defence industry competitiveness, guide the priorities across defence industry, and connect Defence capability with innovation.\nAround $730 million to 2025â26 will be provided for research on next generation technologies with the potential to deliver gameâchanging capabilities critical to defence and national security.\nThe Defence Innovation Hub (the Hub) will be a virtual network, funded at around $640 million to 2025â26 to bring together Defenceâs innovation programs. The Hub will enable defence industry to collaborate on innovation efforts that deliver a capability edge throughout the capability life cycle from initial concept, through prototyping and testing to introduction into service.\nThe Defence Innovation Portal, as part of the Centre for Defence Industry Capability, will be a key communication bridge between Defence, industry and academia, providing vital connections between small to medium enterprises and Defence.\nA Strong and Sustainable Australian Naval Shipbuilding Industry\nA strong, viable and sustainable Australian naval shipbuilding industry is a vital element of Australiaâs defence capability to manage Australiaâs strategic challenges to 2035. The Government is delivering a longâterm plan to ensure retention of a sovereign Australian naval shipbuilding industry and the jobs that go with it. The Governmentâs strategy is centred on a longâterm continuous build of major warships and minor naval vessels in Australia.\nIn the short term, the continuous build strategy will sustain around 1,000 jobs that would otherwise have been lost, and will guarantee around 2,500 longâterm Australian surface shipbuilding jobs for decades to come. This strategy will transform Australiaâs shipbuilding industry and put an end to the boomâbust cycle that has afflicted the industry, and has led to the current shipbuilding âvalley of deathâ. The Government is confident in the ability of Australian defence industry to play its part in moving to a continuous build program for naval surface ships, which will require unprecedented reform of the Australian naval shipbuilding industry focused on significant improvements in productivity.\nDefence Service \u0026 Personnel Records\nFreedom of Information\nInformation Publication Scheme\nPopular publications\nAnnual reports\nBudget\nDefence White Paper\nFOI Disclosures\nInquiry Reports\nPay \u0026 Conditions Manual\nPublications\nIn focus\nPathway to Change\nFighting Fit - ADF Health Portal\nAnzac Centenary\nAnzac Day\nFirst Principles Review\nReport Abuse and Misconduct\nSeMPRO : Victim focused\nFamily and Domestic Violence\nLike the website?\nWe welcome you to take our 20 second survey and help us improve the site.\n \nFeedback\n \nMinister for Defence\nHome page\nBiography\nMedia releases\nSpeeches\nTranscripts\nDefence Service \u0026 Personnel Records\nFreedom of Information\nInformation Publication Scheme\nPopular publications\nAnnual reports\nBudget\nDefence White Paper\nFOI Disclosures\nInquiry Reports\nPay \u0026 Conditions Manual\nPublications\nIn focus\nPathway to Change\nFighting Fit - ADF Health Portal\nAnzac Centenary\nAnzac Day\nFirst Principles Review\nReport Abuse and Misconduct\nSeMPRO : Victim focused\nFamily and Domestic Violence\nLike the website?\nWe welcome you to take our 20 second survey and help us improve the site.\n \nFeedback\n \nMinister for Defence\nHome page\nBiography\nMedia releases\nSpeeches\nTranscripts\nDefending Australia and its National Interests\nContact us\nCopyright\nDisclaimer\nPrivacy\nAccessibility\nSitemap\nError/bug\nToggle responsive view\nBack to top\n","title":"   \t  Defence Industry : At a Glance       : Department of Defence","url":"http://defence.gov.au/Whitepaper/AtAGlance/Defence-Industry.asp","version":1},"task":{"breadth":0,"created":"2018-09-27T21:43:55.534336782Z","depth":0,"host":"defence.gov.au","id":"bemku6ot87468b6omfc0","last_check":"2018-09-27T21:46:15.027530355Z","last_fetch":"2018-09-27T21:46:14.757990215Z","next_check":"2018-09-27T21:56:15.027530355Z","original_url":"http://defence.gov.au/Whitepaper/AtAGlance/Defence-Industry.asp","reference_url":"http://defence.gov.au/WhitePaper/","schema":"http","snapshot_created":"2018-09-27T21:46:14.757960453Z","snapshot_hash":"79ffecfdb17899acfdb55d81696e06a8384a7d85","snapshot_id":"bemkv9gt8746bdj87oag","snapshot_version":1,"status":3,"updated":"2018-09-27T21:46:14.703613283Z","url":"http://defence.gov.au/Whitepaper/AtAGlance/Defence-Industry.asp"}},"fields":{"snapshot.title.keyword":["   \t  Defence Industry : At a Glance       : Department of Defence"]},"inner_hits":{"collpased_docs":{"hits":{"total":1,"max_score":1.4586792,"hits":[{"_index":"gopa-index","_type":"doc","_id":"e2edd4c2a6d14fd3a1088a57da104e74","_score":1.4586792,"_source":{"host":"defence.gov.au","snapshot":{"content_type":"text/html","created":"2018-09-27T21:46:14.757960453Z","description":"\nAt a glance.

The Government will invest around 18 percent of Defence capital expenditure to 2025â26 in our land combat and amphibious warfare capabilities through greater situational awareness, firepower, protection, mobility and force sustainability. These enhancements will increase Australiaâs capacity for both combat and noncombat operations, including for security and stabilisation operations and the provision of humanitarian assistance and disaster relief.\nKey land combat and amphibious warfare capabilities\nAustralian soldiers will continue to receive the worldâclass equipment, weapons systems and protection they need to undertake their important roles. Key weapons systems to be acquired include: new rifles and pistols; direct fire support weapons, including those used against armoured vehicles, bunkers and installations; and indirect weapons such as mortars. New improved personal protection equipment will be acquired, such as body armour, nightâfighting equipment, and protective equipment to mitigate chemical, biological and radiological threats. Defence will continuously monitor, adapt and improve the personal equipment and weapons systems to respond quickly to evolving operational requirements.\nNew combat reconnaissance, infantry fighting, new generation armoured and protected mobility fleets and upgrades to the M1 Abrams Main Battle Tanks will ensure our forces have the protection, mobility and firepower they need to defeat potential adversaries on the future battlefield. On 5 October, 2015, the Government announced acquisition of 1,100 locally built Hawkei protected vehicles and over 1,000 trailers.\nOur land forces will have unprecedented knowledge of what is happening around them and the firepower to respond. A new armed intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR) unmanned aircraft capability is programmed for the early 2020s, to facilitate the timely delivery of accurate information to commanders at all levels, and provide superior situational awareness to inform decisionâmaking. This capability will enhance the Australian Defence Forceâs counterâterrorism support capability overseas and could augment search and rescue, humanitarian assistance and disaster relief and coastal surveillance. New small unmanned aircraft will provide better realâtime ISR support to tactical commanders.\nA new long range rocket system will be acquired in the midâ2020s to provide additional firepower at greater distances (up to around 300km) to complement our existing artillery capability. Our 22 Tiger Armed Reconnaissance helicopters, which provide firepower for our land force operations, will be replaced from the mid 2020s by manned or unmanned systems, or a combination of both, depending on technological developments.\nNew protected and unprotected engineering platforms including cranes, excavators, front end loaders, forklifts, and tractors; armoured bridging and breaching platforms; aviation and fire trucks; and other support capabilities will be acquired over the next decade to support our forces.\nBattlefield logistic support to our troops will be enhanced, including deployable logistics information systems, and replacement of maritime transport vessels. A riverine patrol capability will be reâestablished through a fleet of lightly armed boats from around 2022 to allow operations in estuarine environments. New deployable land communication networks, including satellite and terrestrial communications, will equip our forces with the communications capabilities they need for future operations.\nAmphibious capability\nAustraliaâs strengthened amphibious capability centres around our new\nCanberra\nClass amphibious ships, which will provide the ADF with an unprecedented capability to conduct a wide range of operations in the maritime environment. These amphibious ships will enable the ADF to land a sizeable force of personnel and equipment across a broad spectrum of operations. The\nCanberra\nClass shipsâ onâboard hospital and their ability to operate without wharves or port infrastructure will be a major asset in support of both domestic and international disaster recovery missions. Over time, the capability of the ships will be enhanced to better support joint command and control, including upgrades to communications and intelligence systems and semiâautonomous self defence capabilities. In the longer term, we will replace the shipsâ landing craft used to transport people and equipment from ship to shore. Together with our logistics support ship, HMAS\nChoules\n, the amphibious ships will provide scalable and flexible options for amphibious operations and sea lift.\nSpecial Forces\nAustraliaâs Special Forces undertake complex tactical operations across a range of combat environments. This includes a range of specialist response options when deployed overseas, such as supporting air strikes, reconnaissance and rescue missions. Special Forces are also responsible for domestic counterâterrorism roles when required. Our capability will be significantly enhanced with new highâend weapons, improved mission command networks and situational awareness tools, enhanced tactical mobility, specialised force protection, and logistic support capabilities. The Government will also deliver a new fleet of light helicopters (which are rapidly deployable by transport aircraft) from the midâ2020s to enhance mobility for special operations missions.\nPeople\nAround 700 additional ADF positions will be allocated to 2025â26 to support our strengthened land combat and amphibious warfare capabilities.\nInfrastructure\nWe will upgrade bases including in Brisbane, Darwin, Sydney, Puckapunyal in Victoria, and Townsville, and weapon ranges and training areas such as Puckapunyal and Shoalwater Bay, Queensland to 2025â26. Upgrades to HMAS Stirling in Perth and Fleet Base East (Garden Island) in Sydney will support the amphibious ships. New facilities will support new unmanned aircraft, including at Royal Australian Air Force bases Townsville and Tindal, Northern Territory; Shoalwater Bay; and at the Cultana and Woomera ranges in South Australia.\nDefence Service \u0026 Personnel Records\nFreedom of Information\nInformation Publication Scheme\nPopular publications\nAnnual reports\nBudget\nDefence White Paper\nFOI Disclosures\nInquiry Reports\nPay \u0026 Conditions Manual\nPublications\nIn focus\nPathway to Change\nFighting Fit - ADF Health Portal\nAnzac Centenary\nAnzac Day\nFirst Principles Review\nReport Abuse and Misconduct\nSeMPRO : Victim focused\nFamily and Domestic Violence\nLike the website?\nWe welcome you to take our 20 second survey and help us improve the site.\n \nFeedback\n \nMinister for Defence\nHome page\nBiography\nMedia releases\nSpeeches\nTranscripts\nDefence Service \u0026 Personnel Records\nFreedom of Information\nInformation Publication Scheme\nPopular publications\nAnnual reports\nBudget\nDefence White Paper\nFOI Disclosures\nInquiry Reports\nPay \u0026 Conditions Manual\nPublications\nIn focus\nPathway to Change\nFighting Fit - ADF Health Portal\nAnzac Centenary\nAnzac Day\nFirst Principles Review\nReport Abuse and Misconduct\nSeMPRO : Victim focused\nFamily and Domestic Violence\nLike the website?\nWe welcome you to take our 20 second survey and help us improve the site.\n \nFeedback\n \nMinister for Defence\nHome page\nBiography\nMedia releases\nSpeeches\nTranscripts\nDefending Australia and its National Interests\nContact us\nCopyright\nDisclaimer\nPrivacy\nAccessibility\nSitemap\nError/bug\nToggle responsive view\nBack to top\n","title":"   \t  Land Combat and Amphibious Warfare : At a Glance       : Department of Defence","url":"http://defence.gov.au/Whitepaper/AtAGlance/Land-Combat-Amphib.asp","version":1},"task":{"breadth":0,"created":"2018-09-27T21:43:56.019505784Z","depth":0,"host":"defence.gov.au","id":"bemku70t87468b6omfug","last_check":"2018-09-27T21:46:16.340332338Z","last_fetch":"2018-09-27T21:46:15.992110815Z","next_check":"2018-09-27T21:56:16.340332338Z","original_url":"http://defence.gov.au/Whitepaper/AtAGlance/Land-Combat-Amphib.asp","reference_url":"http://defence.gov.au/WhitePaper/","schema":"http","snapshot_created":"2018-09-27T21:46:15.992087233Z","snapshot_hash":"5a6fcbcdfc8e99f5dfe274fb65b632614c01b22e","snapshot_id":"bemkv9ot8746bdj87u5g","snapshot_version":1,"status":3,"updated":"2018-09-27T21:46:15.982759857Z","url":"http://defence.gov.au/Whitepaper/AtAGlance/Land-Combat-Amphib.asp"}},"fields":{"snapshot.title.keyword":["   \t  Land Combat and Amphibious Warfare : At a Glance       : Department of Defence"]},"inner_hits":{"collpased_docs":{"hits":{"total":1,"max_score":1.3814803,"hits":[{"_index":"gopa-index","_type":"doc","_id":"bd8dd3363ee9467e934451bb904a5425","_score":1.3814803,"_source":{"host":"defence.gov.au","snapshot":{"content_type":"text/html","created":"2018-09-27T21:46:15.992087233Z","description":"\nAt a glance.

The Government will invest around 18 percent of Defence capital expenditure to 2025â26 in our land combat and amphibious warfare capabilities through greater situational awareness, firepower, protection, mobility and force sustainability. These enhancements will increase Australiaâs capacity for both combat and noncombat operations, including for security and stabilisation operations and the provision of humanitarian assistance and disaster relief.\nKey land combat and amphibious warfare capabilities\nAustralian soldiers will continue to receive the worldâclass equipment, weapons systems and protection they need to undertake their important roles. Key weapons systems to be acquired include: new rifles and pistols; direct fire support weapons, including those used against armoured vehicles, bunkers and installations; and indirect weapons such as mortars. New improved personal protection equipment will be acquired, such as body armour, nightâfighting equipment, and protective equipment to mitigate chemical, biological and radiological threats. Defence will continuously monitor, adapt and improve the personal equipment and weapons systems to respond quickly to evolving operational requirements.\nNew combat reconnaissance, infantry fighting, new generation armoured and protected mobility fleets and upgrades to the M1 Abrams Main Battle Tanks will ensure our forces have the protection, mobility and firepower they need to defeat potential adversaries on the future battlefield. On 5 October, 2015, the Government announced acquisition of 1,100 locally built Hawkei protected vehicles and over 1,000 trailers.\nOur land forces will have unprecedented knowledge of what is happening around them and the firepower to respond. A new armed intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR) unmanned aircraft capability is programmed for the early 2020s, to facilitate the timely delivery of accurate information to commanders at all levels, and provide superior situational awareness to inform decisionâmaking. This capability will enhance the Australian Defence Forceâs counterâterrorism support capability overseas and could augment search and rescue, humanitarian assistance and disaster relief and coastal surveillance. New small unmanned aircraft will provide better realâtime ISR support to tactical commanders.\nA new long range rocket system will be acquired in the midâ2020s to provide additional firepower at greater distances (up to around 300km) to complement our existing artillery capability. Our 22 Tiger Armed Reconnaissance helicopters, which provide firepower for our land force operations, will be replaced from the mid 2020s by manned or unmanned systems, or a combination of both, depending on technological developments.\nNew protected and unprotected engineering platforms including cranes, excavators, front end loaders, forklifts, and tractors; armoured bridging and breaching platforms; aviation and fire trucks; and other support capabilities will be acquired over the next decade to support our forces.\nBattlefield logistic support to our troops will be enhanced, including deployable logistics information systems, and replacement of maritime transport vessels. A riverine patrol capability will be reâestablished through a fleet of lightly armed boats from around 2022 to allow operations in estuarine environments. New deployable land communication networks, including satellite and terrestrial communications, will equip our forces with the communications capabilities they need for future operations.\nAmphibious capability\nAustraliaâs strengthened amphibious capability centres around our new\nCanberra\nClass amphibious ships, which will provide the ADF with an unprecedented capability to conduct a wide range of operations in the maritime environment. These amphibious ships will enable the ADF to land a sizeable force of personnel and equipment across a broad spectrum of operations. The\nCanberra\nClass shipsâ onâboard hospital and their ability to operate without wharves or port infrastructure will be a major asset in support of both domestic and international disaster recovery missions. Over time, the capability of the ships will be enhanced to better support joint command and control, including upgrades to communications and intelligence systems and semiâautonomous self defence capabilities. In the longer term, we will replace the shipsâ landing craft used to transport people and equipment from ship to shore. Together with our logistics support ship, HMAS\nChoules\n, the amphibious ships will provide scalable and flexible options for amphibious operations and sea lift.\nSpecial Forces\nAustraliaâs Special Forces undertake complex tactical operations across a range of combat environments. This includes a range of specialist response options when deployed overseas, such as supporting air strikes, reconnaissance and rescue missions. Special Forces are also responsible for domestic counterâterrorism roles when required. Our capability will be significantly enhanced with new highâend weapons, improved mission command networks and situational awareness tools, enhanced tactical mobility, specialised force protection, and logistic support capabilities. The Government will also deliver a new fleet of light helicopters (which are rapidly deployable by transport aircraft) from the midâ2020s to enhance mobility for special operations missions.\nPeople\nAround 700 additional ADF positions will be allocated to 2025â26 to support our strengthened land combat and amphibious warfare capabilities.\nInfrastructure\nWe will upgrade bases including in Brisbane, Darwin, Sydney, Puckapunyal in Victoria, and Townsville, and weapon ranges and training areas such as Puckapunyal and Shoalwater Bay, Queensland to 2025â26. Upgrades to HMAS Stirling in Perth and Fleet Base East (Garden Island) in Sydney will support the amphibious ships. New facilities will support new unmanned aircraft, including at Royal Australian Air Force bases Townsville and Tindal, Northern Territory; Shoalwater Bay; and at the Cultana and Woomera ranges in South Australia.\nDefence Service \u0026 Personnel Records\nFreedom of Information\nInformation Publication Scheme\nPopular publications\nAnnual reports\nBudget\nDefence White Paper\nFOI Disclosures\nInquiry Reports\nPay \u0026 Conditions Manual\nPublications\nIn focus\nPathway to Change\nFighting Fit - ADF Health Portal\nAnzac Centenary\nAnzac Day\nFirst Principles Review\nReport Abuse and Misconduct\nSeMPRO : Victim focused\nFamily and Domestic Violence\nLike the website?\nWe welcome you to take our 20 second survey and help us improve the site.\n \nFeedback\n \nMinister for Defence\nHome page\nBiography\nMedia releases\nSpeeches\nTranscripts\nDefence Service \u0026 Personnel Records\nFreedom of Information\nInformation Publication Scheme\nPopular publications\nAnnual reports\nBudget\nDefence White Paper\nFOI Disclosures\nInquiry Reports\nPay \u0026 Conditions Manual\nPublications\nIn focus\nPathway to Change\nFighting Fit - ADF Health Portal\nAnzac Centenary\nAnzac Day\nFirst Principles Review\nReport Abuse and Misconduct\nSeMPRO : Victim focused\nFamily and Domestic Violence\nLike the website?\nWe welcome you to take our 20 second survey and help us improve the site.\n \nFeedback\n \nMinister for Defence\nHome page\nBiography\nMedia releases\nSpeeches\nTranscripts\nDefending Australia and its National Interests\nContact us\nCopyright\nDisclaimer\nPrivacy\nAccessibility\nSitemap\nError/bug\nToggle responsive view\nBack to top\n","title":"   \t  Land Combat and Amphibious Warfare : At a Glance       : Department of Defence","url":"http://defence.gov.au/Whitepaper/AtAGlance/Land-Combat-Amphib.asp","version":1},"task":{"breadth":0,"created":"2018-09-27T21:43:56.019505784Z","depth":0,"host":"defence.gov.au","id":"bemku70t87468b6omfug","last_check":"2018-09-27T21:46:16.340332338Z","last_fetch":"2018-09-27T21:46:15.992110815Z","next_check":"2018-09-27T21:56:16.340332338Z","original_url":"http://defence.gov.au/Whitepaper/AtAGlance/Land-Combat-Amphib.asp","reference_url":"http://defence.gov.au/WhitePaper/","schema":"http","snapshot_created":"2018-09-27T21:46:15.992087233Z","snapshot_hash":"5a6fcbcdfc8e99f5dfe274fb65b632614c01b22e","snapshot_id":"bemkv9ot8746bdj87u5g","snapshot_version":1,"status":3,"updated":"2018-09-27T21:46:15.982759857Z","url":"http://defence.gov.au/Whitepaper/AtAGlance/Land-Combat-Amphib.asp"}}}]}}}},{"_index":"gopa-index","_type":"doc","_id":"a8eeff92a2a3638bd14c12743072772b","_score":1.3814803,"_source":{"host":"defence.gov.au","snapshot":{"content_type":"text/html","created":"2018-09-27T21:46:14.703847935Z","description":"\nAt a glance.

The Government will invest around 25 percent of Defence capital expenditure to 2025â26 in our maritime capabilities in the most comprehensive regeneration of our Navy since the Second World War. Our maritime forces will become more potent out to the 2030s through more capable submarines, ships and aircraft and better integration of combat and supporting systems across Defence. This will enable our forces to protect our maritime borders and resources, secure our immediate northern approaches and proximate sea lines of communication, and project force in the maritime environment.\nKey maritime operations and antiâsubmarine warfare capabilities\nThe future submarine program is the largest defence procurement in Australiaâs history. A fleet of 12 new regionally superior submarines with a high degree of interoperability with the United States will replace the six current\nCollins\nClass submarines. The new submarines will provide an essential element of Australiaâs deterrent capability. The key roles of the future submarine will include: antiâsubmarine warfare; antiâsurface vessel warfare; intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance; and support to special operations. The results of the competitive evaluation process will be announced this year. The\nCollins\nClass submarine fleet will continue to be supported and upgraded to ensure that it remains a potent capability through the rest of its life and until transition to the new submarine.\nThe new submarines will likely begin to enter service in the early 2030s, with delivery extending over two decades to around 2050. A rolling acquisition program for Australiaâs future submarines will ensure that Australia is able to maintain a fleet of 12 regionally superior submarines as submarine and antiâsubmarine technologies develop over time. As part of a rolling acquisition program, a review of strategic circumstances and developments in submarine technology will be conducted in the late 2020s to consider whether the configuration of the submarines remains suitable or whether consideration of other specifications should commence. A rolling program of acquiring submarines will provide longâterm planning certainty for Australian industry, allowing companies to invest in the capabilities needed to support their involvement in the construction and sustainment activities.\nNine new antiâsubmarine warfare frigates will be introduced into service from the late 2020s, with construction to start in 2020, to replace the existing fleet of eight ANZAC Class frigates. The new frigates will have the range and endurance to operate throughout maritime South East Asia and be deployable from forward bases, such as in the Middle East. They will be equipped with offensive and selfâprotection systems.\nTwelve new offshore patrol vessels (OPV) will begin entering service from the early 2020s, with construction to start in 2018, replacing the 13\nArmidale\nClass patrol boats. The OPVs will have greater reach, endurance and capacity than the\nArmidale\nClass patrol boat fleet, allowing them to perform a broader range of border protection and patrol missions.\nAustraliaâs maritime surveillance and response capability will be significantly enhanced through the Governmentâs acquisition of seven additional Pâ8A Poseidon maritime surveillance and response aircraft to be acquired in two tranches for a total of 15 by the late 2020s. In addition to their sophisticated surveillance capabilities, these aircraft can undertake offensive operations against submarines and ships, as well as supporting search and rescue operations.\nTo improve our shipsâ situational awareness on operations, a new maritime tactical unmanned aircraft will also be delivered over the next decade. The tactical unmanned aircraft will be deployable on a range of Royal Australian Navy vessels including the OPVs and antiâsubmarine warfare frigates.\nAustraliaâs military hydrography capability provides sailors with precision measurement of the physical features of the oceans and water mass. The current fleet of two large and four smaller ADF hydrographic survey vessels will be progressively retired from around the early 2020s. Defence will replace this capability with an efficient combination of military and commercial hydrographic and oceanographic survey capabilities to deliver the required capacity.\nThree\nHobart\nClass Air Warfare Destroyers will be in service by the early 2020s. To ensure these vessels can keep pace with regional capabilities, upgrades will be made to the AEGIS combat system, weapons, selfâprotection and intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance systems throughout their service life. The vessels will provide Australian and coalition maritime task with defence against air and missile attack.\n24 MHâ60R Seahawk naval combat helicopters are currently being accepted into service. They will enhance the\nHobart\nClass Air Warfare Destroyersâ and\nANZAC\nClass Frigatesâ antiâship and antiâsubmarine warfare operations. A maritime fleet of up to eight MRHâ90 helicopters will support the amphibious and replenishment ship fleet.\nEnhancements to Defenceâs maritime capabilities will provide Australia with enhanced situational awareness of activities in our maritime domain, earlier detection of emerging threats to our border security and faster responses to deter and defeat any such threat.\nPeople\nAn additional around 800 ADF positions will be allocated to 2025â26 to support the substantially larger maritime force. The workforce will need to continue to grow beyond 2025â26, in particular to operate the larger fleet of submarines.\nInfrastructure\nWharf, and training and support facility upgrades to HMAS Stirling in Perth and Fleet Base East (Garden Island) in Sydney to 2025â26 will support our larger and more potent maritime capability.

The Government will invest around 25 percent of Defence capital expenditure to 2025â26 in our maritime capabilities in the most comprehensive regeneration of our Navy since the Second World War. Our maritime forces will become more potent out to the 2030s through more capable submarines, ships and aircraft and better integration of combat and supporting systems across Defence. This will enable our forces to protect our maritime borders and resources, secure our immediate northern approaches and proximate sea lines of communication, and project force in the maritime environment.\nKey maritime operations and antiâsubmarine warfare capabilities\nThe future submarine program is the largest defence procurement in Australiaâs history. A fleet of 12 new regionally superior submarines with a high degree of interoperability with the United States will replace the six current\nCollins\nClass submarines. The new submarines will provide an essential element of Australiaâs deterrent capability. The key roles of the future submarine will include: antiâsubmarine warfare; antiâsurface vessel warfare; intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance; and support to special operations. The results of the competitive evaluation process will be announced this year. The\nCollins\nClass submarine fleet will continue to be supported and upgraded to ensure that it remains a potent capability through the rest of its life and until transition to the new submarine.\nThe new submarines will likely begin to enter service in the early 2030s, with delivery extending over two decades to around 2050. A rolling acquisition program for Australiaâs future submarines will ensure that Australia is able to maintain a fleet of 12 regionally superior submarines as submarine and antiâsubmarine technologies develop over time. As part of a rolling acquisition program, a review of strategic circumstances and developments in submarine technology will be conducted in the late 2020s to consider whether the configuration of the submarines remains suitable or whether consideration of other specifications should commence. A rolling program of acquiring submarines will provide longâterm planning certainty for Australian industry, allowing companies to invest in the capabilities needed to support their involvement in the construction and sustainment activities.\nNine new antiâsubmarine warfare frigates will be introduced into service from the late 2020s, with construction to start in 2020, to replace the existing fleet of eight ANZAC Class frigates. The new frigates will have the range and endurance to operate throughout maritime South East Asia and be deployable from forward bases, such as in the Middle East. They will be equipped with offensive and selfâprotection systems.\nTwelve new offshore patrol vessels (OPV) will begin entering service from the early 2020s, with construction to start in 2018, replacing the 13\nArmidale\nClass patrol boats. The OPVs will have greater reach, endurance and capacity than the\nArmidale\nClass patrol boat fleet, allowing them to perform a broader range of border protection and patrol missions.\nAustraliaâs maritime surveillance and response capability will be significantly enhanced through the Governmentâs acquisition of seven additional Pâ8A Poseidon maritime surveillance and response aircraft to be acquired in two tranches for a total of 15 by the late 2020s. In addition to their sophisticated surveillance capabilities, these aircraft can undertake offensive operations against submarines and ships, as well as supporting search and rescue operations.\nTo improve our shipsâ situational awareness on operations, a new maritime tactical unmanned aircraft will also be delivered over the next decade. The tactical unmanned aircraft will be deployable on a range of Royal Australian Navy vessels including the OPVs and antiâsubmarine warfare frigates.\nAustraliaâs military hydrography capability provides sailors with precision measurement of the physical features of the oceans and water mass. The current fleet of two large and four smaller ADF hydrographic survey vessels will be progressively retired from around the early 2020s. Defence will replace this capability with an efficient combination of military and commercial hydrographic and oceanographic survey capabilities to deliver the required capacity.\nThree\nHobart\nClass Air Warfare Destroyers will be in service by the early 2020s. To ensure these vessels can keep pace with regional capabilities, upgrades will be made to the AEGIS combat system, weapons, selfâprotection and intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance systems throughout their service life. The vessels will provide Australian and coalition maritime task with defence against air and missile attack.\n24 MHâ60R Seahawk naval combat helicopters are currently being accepted into service. They will enhance the\nHobart\nClass Air Warfare Destroyersâ and\nANZAC\nClass Frigatesâ antiâship and antiâsubmarine warfare operations. A maritime fleet of up to eight MRHâ90 helicopters will support the amphibious and replenishment ship fleet.\nEnhancements to Defenceâs maritime capabilities will provide Australia with enhanced situational awareness of activities in our maritime domain, earlier detection of emerging threats to our border security and faster responses to deter and defeat any such threat.\nPeople\nAn additional around 800 ADF positions will be allocated to 2025â26 to support the substantially larger maritime force. The workforce will need to continue to grow beyond 2025â26, in particular to operate the larger fleet of submarines.\nInfrastructure\nWharf, and training and support facility upgrades to HMAS Stirling in Perth and Fleet Base East (Garden Island) in Sydney to 2025â26 will support our larger and more potent maritime capability. Infrastructure works at Cocos (Keeling) Islands, Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) Base Edinburgh, South Australia; and RAAF Base Tindal, Northern Territory, will ensure that these airfields can support the fleet of Pâ8A Poseidon aircraft. A range of training areas, testing ranges, and other Defence bases will be upgraded to 2025â26 to support our maritime capabilities, including recruitment facilities such as HMAS Cerberus in Victoria.\nDefence Service \u0026 Personnel Records\nFreedom of Information\nInformation Publication Scheme\nPopular publications\nAnnual reports\nBudget\nDefence White Paper\nFOI Disclosures\nInquiry Reports\nPay \u0026 Conditions Manual\nPublications\nIn focus\nPathway to Change\nFighting Fit - ADF Health Portal\nAnzac Centenary\nAnzac Day\nFirst Principles Review\nReport Abuse and Misconduct\nSeMPRO : Victim focused\nFamily and Domestic Violence\nLike the website?\nWe welcome you to take our 20 second survey and help us improve the site.\n \nFeedback\n \nMinister for Defence\nHome page\nBiography\nMedia releases\nSpeeches\nTranscripts\nDefence Service \u0026 Personnel Records\nFreedom of Information\nInformation Publication Scheme\nPopular publications\nAnnual reports\nBudget\nDefence White Paper\nFOI Disclosures\nInquiry Reports\nPay \u0026 Conditions Manual\nPublications\nIn focus\nPathway to Change\nFighting Fit - ADF Health Portal\nAnzac Centenary\nAnzac Day\nFirst Principles Review\nReport Abuse and Misconduct\nSeMPRO : Victim focused\nFamily and Domestic Violence\nLike the website?\nWe welcome you to take our 20 second survey and help us improve the site.\n \nFeedback\n \nMinister for Defence\nHome page\nBiography\nMedia releases\nSpeeches\nTranscripts\nDefending Australia and its National Interests\nContact us\nCopyright\nDisclaimer\nPrivacy\nAccessibility\nSitemap\nError/bug\nToggle responsive view\nBack to top\n","title":"   \t  Maritime Operations and Anti-Submarine Warfare : At a Glance       : Department of Defence","url":"http://defence.gov.au/Whitepaper/AtAGlance/Maritime-Ops.asp","version":1},"task":{"breadth":0,"created":"2018-09-27T21:43:55.534177015Z","depth":0,"host":"defence.gov.au","id":"bemku6ot87468b6omfbg","last_check":"2018-09-27T21:46:14.820275373Z","last_fetch":"2018-09-27T21:46:14.703867657Z","next_check":"2018-09-27T21:56:14.820275373Z","original_url":"http://defence.gov.au/Whitepaper/AtAGlance/Maritime-Ops.asp","reference_url":"http://defence.gov.au/WhitePaper/","schema":"http","snapshot_created":"2018-09-27T21:46:14.703847935Z","snapshot_hash":"56530c14738aca4d2fb8f707895eb5c0afa970c6","snapshot_id":"bemkv9gt8746bdj87oa0","snapshot_version":1,"status":3,"updated":"2018-09-27T21:46:14.683088144Z","url":"http://defence.gov.au/Whitepaper/AtAGlance/Maritime-Ops.asp"}}}]}}}},{"_index":"gopa-index","_type":"doc","_id":"0a8a3cd56f945ebdafdd7043976c9df9","_score":1.3814803,"_source":{"host":"defence.gov.au","snapshot":{"content_type":"text/html","created":"2018-09-27T21:46:14.819521141Z","description":"\nAt a glance.

This force will be achieved through the\nGovernmentâs funding plan, which raises Defence funding to two per cent of Gross Domestic\nProduction by 2020â21. The Defence budget will rise from $32.4 billion in 2016â17 to $58.7 billion in\n2025â26, with approximately $195 billion to be invested in Defence capability over this period.\nMaritime Operations and AntiâSubmarine Warfare\nThe Government will invest around 25 per cent of Defence capability expenditure to 2025â26 in our\nmaritime operations and antiâsubmarine warfare capabilities as part of a significant regeneration of\nour maritime capabilities. Key capabilities will include: 12 new regionally superior submarines; nine\nnew antiâsubmarine warfare frigates; 12 new offshore patrol vessels; seven additional Pâ8A Poseidon\nmaritime surveillance and response aircraft for a total of 15 aircraft by the late 2020s (which will\ncomplement the seven MQâ4C Triton unmanned surveillance aircraft); new maritime tactical\nunmanned aircraft to improve our shipsâ situational awareness on operations; modernised mine\ncountermeasures and hydrographicârelated capabilities; and a new deployable landâbased antiâship\nmissile capability.\nIntelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance, Space, Electronic Warfare and\nCyber Security\nThe Government will invest around nine per cent of Defence capability expenditure to 2025â26 in\nstrengthening our intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance, electronic warfare, space, and cyber\ncapabilities so that our forces have a comprehensive awareness of what is happening around them\nand the ability to respond. Key capabilities will include: enhanced intelligence collection and analysis,\nincluding in support of targeting; enhancements to broad area surveillance through the acquisition\nof the MQâ4C Triton unmanned surveillance aircraft and enhancements to the Jindalee Operational\nRadar Network; strengthened electronic warfare support to naval, air and land forces, including\nthrough the 12 E/Aâ18G Growler electronic attack aircraft and a new long range electronic warfare\nsupport capability based on the Gulfstream G550 airframe, with additional modified systems;\nenhanced space situational awareness; and enhanced cyber capabilities to deter and defend against\nthe threat of cyber attack.\nKey Enablers\nThe Government will invest around 25 per cent of Defence capability expenditure to 2025â26 in the\nenablers that are essential to the operation and sustainment of the ADF. Even the most capable\nplatforms and systems will not be effective without the enabling capabilities that allow those\nplatforms to operate. Key enabling capabilities to receive substantial investment over the next\ndecade include: our people; critical infrastructure such as bases, training ranges, wharves and\nairfields; information and communications technology; simulators; logistics; science and technology;\nhealth services; and strengthening force design, strategic and international policy.\nAir and Sea Lift\nThe Government will invest around six per cent of Defence capability expenditure to 2025â26 in air\nand sea lift capabilities. The long distances over which the ADF is required to operate means flexible\nand high endurance air and sea lift capabilities are essential to lift, move, and sustain the ADF.\nKey capabilities will include: two additional heavyâlift Câ17A Globemaster III transport aircraft\nalready acquired to complement the existing six Câ17A fleet (with consideration of further additional\nheavy lift aircraft at a later stage); two additional KCâ30A airâtoâair refuellers for a total of seven\naircraft (expanding the fleet to nine aircraft will be considered in the longer term); three additional\nCHâ47F Chinook heavyâlift helicopters to complement previously planned CHâ47F Chinook heavyâlift\nhelicopters for a fleet of 10 aircraft, extension and upgrades for the logistics support ship,\nHMAS Choules; two new replenishment ships by 2026 to resupply naval forces with the option for a\nthird replenishment or additional logistics ship in the late 2020s; and a large hulled multiâpurpose\npatrol vessel for the Navy to support border protection and maritime resource security related tasks.\nStrike and Air Combat\nThe Government will invest around 17 per cent of Defence capability expenditure to 2025â26 in our\nstrike and air combat capabilities. More potent strike capabilities will provide flexibility for the ADF\nto rapidly respond to threats against Australia and provide military contributions to support regional\nsecurity and coalition operations globally where our interests are engaged.

This force will be achieved through the\nGovernmentâs funding plan, which raises Defence funding to two per cent of Gross Domestic\nProduction by 2020â21. The Defence budget will rise from $32.4 billion in 2016â17 to $58.7 billion in\n2025â26, with approximately $195 billion to be invested in Defence capability over this period.\nMaritime Operations and AntiâSubmarine Warfare\nThe Government will invest around 25 per cent of Defence capability expenditure to 2025â26 in our\nmaritime operations and antiâsubmarine warfare capabilities as part of a significant regeneration of\nour maritime capabilities. Key capabilities will include: 12 new regionally superior submarines; nine\nnew antiâsubmarine warfare frigates; 12 new offshore patrol vessels; seven additional Pâ8A Poseidon\nmaritime surveillance and response aircraft for a total of 15 aircraft by the late 2020s (which will\ncomplement the seven MQâ4C Triton unmanned surveillance aircraft); new maritime tactical\nunmanned aircraft to improve our shipsâ situational awareness on operations; modernised mine\ncountermeasures and hydrographicârelated capabilities; and a new deployable landâbased antiâship\nmissile capability.\nIntelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance, Space, Electronic Warfare and\nCyber Security\nThe Government will invest around nine per cent of Defence capability expenditure to 2025â26 in\nstrengthening our intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance, electronic warfare, space, and cyber\ncapabilities so that our forces have a comprehensive awareness of what is happening around them\nand the ability to respond. Key capabilities will include: enhanced intelligence collection and analysis,\nincluding in support of targeting; enhancements to broad area surveillance through the acquisition\nof the MQâ4C Triton unmanned surveillance aircraft and enhancements to the Jindalee Operational\nRadar Network; strengthened electronic warfare support to naval, air and land forces, including\nthrough the 12 E/Aâ18G Growler electronic attack aircraft and a new long range electronic warfare\nsupport capability based on the Gulfstream G550 airframe, with additional modified systems;\nenhanced space situational awareness; and enhanced cyber capabilities to deter and defend against\nthe threat of cyber attack.\nKey Enablers\nThe Government will invest around 25 per cent of Defence capability expenditure to 2025â26 in the\nenablers that are essential to the operation and sustainment of the ADF. Even the most capable\nplatforms and systems will not be effective without the enabling capabilities that allow those\nplatforms to operate. Key enabling capabilities to receive substantial investment over the next\ndecade include: our people; critical infrastructure such as bases, training ranges, wharves and\nairfields; information and communications technology; simulators; logistics; science and technology;\nhealth services; and strengthening force design, strategic and international policy.\nAir and Sea Lift\nThe Government will invest around six per cent of Defence capability expenditure to 2025â26 in air\nand sea lift capabilities. The long distances over which the ADF is required to operate means flexible\nand high endurance air and sea lift capabilities are essential to lift, move, and sustain the ADF.\nKey capabilities will include: two additional heavyâlift Câ17A Globemaster III transport aircraft\nalready acquired to complement the existing six Câ17A fleet (with consideration of further additional\nheavy lift aircraft at a later stage); two additional KCâ30A airâtoâair refuellers for a total of seven\naircraft (expanding the fleet to nine aircraft will be considered in the longer term); three additional\nCHâ47F Chinook heavyâlift helicopters to complement previously planned CHâ47F Chinook heavyâlift\nhelicopters for a fleet of 10 aircraft, extension and upgrades for the logistics support ship,\nHMAS Choules; two new replenishment ships by 2026 to resupply naval forces with the option for a\nthird replenishment or additional logistics ship in the late 2020s; and a large hulled multiâpurpose\npatrol vessel for the Navy to support border protection and maritime resource security related tasks.\nStrike and Air Combat\nThe Government will invest around 17 per cent of Defence capability expenditure to 2025â26 in our\nstrike and air combat capabilities. More potent strike capabilities will provide flexibility for the ADF\nto rapidly respond to threats against Australia and provide military contributions to support regional\nsecurity and coalition operations globally where our interests are engaged. Key capabilities will\ninclude: 72 Fâ35A Lightning II Joint Strike Fighters to enter service from 2020 to replace the current\nfleet of 71 F/Aâ18A/B Classic Hornets; 12 EAâ18G Growler electronic attack aircraft to enter service\nfrom 2018; new airâtoâsurface, airâtoâair and highâspeed and longârange strike and antiâship\nweapons; and strengthened command and control, integrated air and missile defence, and\nsituational awareness capabilities to support strike and air combat operations.\nLand Combat and Amphibious Warfare\nThe Government will invest around 18 per cent of Defence capability expenditure to 2025â26 in our\nland combat and amphibious warfare capabilities to provide greater mobility, firepower, protection\nand situational awareness. Key capabilities will include: a new program for continuous upgrade of\npersonal equipment and force protection for our soldiers; new combat reconnaissance, infantry\nfighting, and protected mobility vehicles; upgrades to the M1 Abrams Main Battle Tanks; new armed\nintelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance unmanned aircraft; a new longârange rocket system to\ncomplement existing artillery; logistics enablers to support the amphibious deployment capability of\nthe two Canberra Class ships; and a new fleet of lightly armed boats for operations in a wide range\nof estuarine environments.

The Government will invest around 17 per cent of Defence capital expenditure in our strike and air combat capabilities to 2025â26. More potent strike capabilities will provide flexibility for the Australian Defence Force (ADF) to rapidly respond to threats against Australia and provide military contributions to support regional security and coalition operations globally, where our interests are engaged.\nThe ADF will be equipped with a potent and technologically advanced air combat and strike capability, building on the current fleet of 24 F/Aâ18F Super Hornets, 71 F/Aâ18A/B Classic Hornets, and six Eâ7A Wedgetail airborne early warning and control aircraft.\nKey Strike and Air Combat capabilities\nThe Government will ensure that the ADF has the most capable weapons to fulfil its strike and air combat missions in the future. A series of new airâtoâsurface, airâtoâair and highâspeed and longârange strike and antiâship weapons will be acquired for the strike and air combat capability.\nThe ADFâs integrated air and missile defence system will also be enhanced to improve the accuracy and speed of ADF systemsâ response to air and missile threats, and to integrate and share air and space surveillance information more effectively. The Government will increase investment in capabilities to better connect the communications, sensor and targeting systems of various platforms so that they can more effectively combine their capabilities, generating greater potency and lethality. The ADFâs enhanced integrated air and missile defence capabilities will have the flexibility for further enhancement to handle more complex threats that may emerge in the future.\nDefence will also acquire groundâbased active electronically scanned array radars from around 2020 and expand Australiaâs access to air and space situational awareness information, including through spaceâbased systems.\nThe Government will also introduce a more sophisticated groundâbased air defence system to replace the shortârange RBSâ70 missile system. A new manâportable shortârange system will be introduced by the early 2020s, and will be supplemented by an advanced tactical and mediumârange surfaceâtoâair missile system in the mid to late 2020s, providing layered airâdefence against a broad range of capable air threats.\nThe 72 fifth generation Fâ35A Lightning II Joint Strike Fighters will enter service from 2020 to replace the F/Aâ18A/B Classic Hornets. The Joint Strike Fighters will use a mix of airâtoâair and airâtoâsurface weapons, operate at extended range, maintaining stealth, providing a true multiârole capability. The 24 F/Aâ18F Super Hornets will complement the Joint Strike Fighter aircraft. The Super Hornets will be able to strike potential adversary targets, control the air, and enable ADF or coalition maritime or land operations to proceed unhindered. After 2020, the Government will consider options to replace the Super Hornets in around 2030.\nThe 12 E/Aâ18G Growler electronic attack aircraft will enter service from 2018.

The Government will invest around 17 per cent of Defence capital expenditure in our strike and air combat capabilities to 2025â26. More potent strike capabilities will provide flexibility for the Australian Defence Force (ADF) to rapidly respond to threats against Australia and provide military contributions to support regional security and coalition operations globally, where our interests are engaged.\nThe ADF will be equipped with a potent and technologically advanced air combat and strike capability, building on the current fleet of 24 F/Aâ18F Super Hornets, 71 F/Aâ18A/B Classic Hornets, and six Eâ7A Wedgetail airborne early warning and control aircraft.\nKey Strike and Air Combat capabilities\nThe Government will ensure that the ADF has the most capable weapons to fulfil its strike and air combat missions in the future. A series of new airâtoâsurface, airâtoâair and highâspeed and longârange strike and antiâship weapons will be acquired for the strike and air combat capability.\nThe ADFâs integrated air and missile defence system will also be enhanced to improve the accuracy and speed of ADF systemsâ response to air and missile threats, and to integrate and share air and space surveillance information more effectively. The Government will increase investment in capabilities to better connect the communications, sensor and targeting systems of various platforms so that they can more effectively combine their capabilities, generating greater potency and lethality. The ADFâs enhanced integrated air and missile defence capabilities will have the flexibility for further enhancement to handle more complex threats that may emerge in the future.\nDefence will also acquire groundâbased active electronically scanned array radars from around 2020 and expand Australiaâs access to air and space situational awareness information, including through spaceâbased systems.\nThe Government will also introduce a more sophisticated groundâbased air defence system to replace the shortârange RBSâ70 missile system. A new manâportable shortârange system will be introduced by the early 2020s, and will be supplemented by an advanced tactical and mediumârange surfaceâtoâair missile system in the mid to late 2020s, providing layered airâdefence against a broad range of capable air threats.\nThe 72 fifth generation Fâ35A Lightning II Joint Strike Fighters will enter service from 2020 to replace the F/Aâ18A/B Classic Hornets. The Joint Strike Fighters will use a mix of airâtoâair and airâtoâsurface weapons, operate at extended range, maintaining stealth, providing a true multiârole capability. The 24 F/Aâ18F Super Hornets will complement the Joint Strike Fighter aircraft. The Super Hornets will be able to strike potential adversary targets, control the air, and enable ADF or coalition maritime or land operations to proceed unhindered. After 2020, the Government will consider options to replace the Super Hornets in around 2030.\nThe 12 E/Aâ18G Growler electronic attack aircraft will enter service from 2018. The aircraft will provide a unique capability to disrupt, disable or confuse adversariesâ electronic systems such as radars and communications systems. The six inâservice Eâ7A Wedgetail airborne early warning and control aircraft will continue to be upgraded in order to maintain their capability edge to the mid 2030s.\nPeople\nApproximately, an additional 500 ADF positions will be allocated to 2025â26 to support the introduction of more potent strike and air combat capabilities.\nInfrastructure\nThe Government will make a significant investment in new infrastructure and facilities to 2025â26 to support the ADFâs strike and air combat capabilities.

The Government will invest around six per cent of Defence capability expenditure to 2025â26 in our air and sea lift capabilities. Given the substantial distances over which the Australian Defence Force (ADF) must operate â nationally, regionally and globally â air and sea lift capabilities are essential. A flexible force of air and sea lift capabilities will enable the ADF to reach, resupply and sustain missions in different locations. The ADF also needs to have lift capacity to be highly mobile within any area of operation.\nKey air and sea lift capabilities\nThe ADFâs strategic transport capability will be greatly enhanced through the already delivered acquisition of two additional heavyâlift Câ17A Globemaster transport aircraft, capable of moving large cargo and numbers of personnel great distances, such as from Australia to the Middle East, increasing our fleet to eight aircraft. Additional heavy lift aircraft will be considered at a later stage.\nThe Government will extend the range of combat and surveillance aircraft, acquiring two additional KCâ30A airâtoâair refuellers before the end of this decade for a total of seven aircraft. Expanding the fleet to nine aircraft in the longer term will be considered to meet increasing demand.\nOur Chinook helicopters are a workhorse of the ADF, capable of moving stores and personnel, including vehicles and artillery around the battlefield or from ships to the land without the need for an airfield as well as undertaking aeroâmedical evacuation. The Government will acquire three additional CHâ47F Chinook heavyâlift helicopters in the near term to expand battlefield lift capacity and support tactical missions including aeroâmedical evacuation for a total of 10 helicopters.\nThe logistics support ship, HMAS Choules, and the two Canberra Class amphibious ships, will provide scalable and flexible options for greater capacity sea lift and amphibious operations. The Government will extend the life of HMAS Choules and update the capabilities onboard, including modern self defence and aviation support systems until it is replaced around 2030.\nIn addition, the Government will acquire a new large hulled multiâpurpose patrol vessel, the Australian Defence Vessel Ocean Protector for the Navy to support border protection and maritime resource security related tasks with the Australian Border Force.\nSustainment of our maritime capabilities will be improved by two new replenishment vessels that will begin service by 2026. The vessels will provide naval combat units with fuel, water and stores while underway at sea. A third replenishment vessel or additional logistics support ship will be acquired the late 2020s.\nTogether, HMAS\nChoules\n, the amphibious ships, and replenishment vessels, will enable the ADF to conduct a greater number of challenging maritime operations at the same time, and to sustain those operations for longer periods than we can today.\nThe Government will acquire enhanced aeroâmedical evacuation and search and rescue capabilities for our forces, with upgrades to aeroâmedical equipment for the Chinook helicopters commencing from 2016. In the longer term, options will be investigated for a dedicated longârange combat search and rescue capability.\nThe Government will upgrade the 12 Câ130J Hercules medium transport aircraft to ensure that they can continue to fulfil their critical role in moving stores and equipment within our region when required.\n10 Câ27J Spartan medium transport aircraft are currently being introduced into service. The Spartans will enhance the ADFâs air lift capability, providing a unique capacity to move personnel and small cargos to remote locations using shorter landing strips not suitable for any other fixed wing military aircraft in the ADF fleet.\nThe MRHâ90 Troop lift helicopter will continue to be introduced into service, with Army to operate 39 to 41 aircraft and Navy to operate up to eight aircraft. The aircraft will be a force multiplier for Army in tactical air mobility and for Navy in maritime support. Current plans include a requirement for roleâspecific upgrades to the MRHâ90 Troop lift helicopter to replace the Sâ70A Blackhawk in support of domestic counter terrorism operations.\nPeople\nAn additional around 800 ADF positions will be allocated to 2025â26 to assist with the air and sea lift fleets, including introduction of the two additional heavy lift Câ17A Globemaster transport aircraft, two additional airâtoâair refuelling aircraft, 10 Câ27J Spartan medium transport aircraft, two new replenishment vessels, and three additional CHâ47 Chinook heavyâlift helicopters.\nInfrastructure\nSubstantial investment in support of air lift is programmed for upgraded infrastructure at RAAF Base Amberley, Queensland, including facilities to support an increased number of tactical, medium and strategic lift aircraft. Funding is also programmed at RAAF Base Richmond, New South Wales, in the latter years of the decade to 2025â26.\nAustraliaâs growing sea lift capability will be supported by planned upgrades to wharves and port facilities, including substantial investment in Fleet Base East, combined with continued commercial arrangements for ADF access to civilian infrastructure.\nDefence Service \u0026 Personnel Records\nFreedom of Information\nInformation Publication Scheme\nPopular publications\nAnnual reports\nBudget\nDefence White Paper\nFOI Disclosures\nInquiry Reports\nPay \u0026 Conditions Manual\nPublications\nIn focus\nPathway to Change\nFighting Fit - ADF Health Portal\nAnzac Centenary\nAnzac Day\nFirst Principles Review\nReport Abuse and Misconduct\nSeMPRO : Victim focused\nFamily and Domestic Violence\nLike the website?\nWe welcome you to take our 20 second survey and help us improve the site.\n \nFeedback\n \nMinister for Defence\nHome page\nBiography\nMedia releases\nSpeeches\nTranscripts\nDefence Service \u0026 Personnel Records\nFreedom of Information\nInformation Publication Scheme\nPopular publications\nAnnual reports\nBudget\nDefence White Paper\nFOI Disclosures\nInquiry Reports\nPay \u0026 Conditions Manual\nPublications\nIn focus\nPathway to Change\nFighting Fit - ADF Health Portal\nAnzac Centenary\nAnzac Day\nFirst Principles Review\nReport Abuse and Misconduct\nSeMPRO : Victim focused\nFamily and Domestic Violence\nLike the website?\nWe welcome you to take our 20 second survey and help us improve the site.\n \nFeedback\n \nMinister for Defence\nHome page\nBiography\nMedia releases\nSpeeches\nTranscripts\nDefending Australia and its National Interests\nContact us\nCopyright\nDisclaimer\nPrivacy\nAccessibility\nSitemap\nError/bug\nToggle responsive view\nBack to top\n","title":"   \t  Air and Sea Lift Capability : At a Glance       : Department of Defence","url":"http://defence.gov.au/Whitepaper/AtAGlance/Air-Sea-Lift.asp","version":1},"task":{"breadth":0,"created":"2018-09-27T21:43:55.533838966Z","depth":0,"host":"defence.gov.au","id":"bemku6ot87468b6omfag","last_check":"2018-09-27T21:46:14.820064928Z","last_fetch":"2018-09-27T21:46:14.642788256Z","next_check":"2018-09-27T21:56:14.820064928Z","original_url":"http://defence.gov.au/Whitepaper/AtAGlance/Air-Sea-Lift.asp","reference_url":"http://defence.gov.au/WhitePaper/","schema":"http","snapshot_created":"2018-09-27T21:46:14.642766527Z","snapshot_hash":"e51262c05664c75bd843b243e177eb7dc9fcc504","snapshot_id":"bemkv9gt8746bdj87o80","snapshot_version":1,"status":3,"updated":"2018-09-27T21:46:14.465695344Z","url":"http://defence.gov.au/Whitepaper/AtAGlance/Air-Sea-Lift.asp"}},"fields":{"snapshot.title.keyword":["   \t  Air and Sea Lift Capability : At a Glance       : Department of Defence"]},"inner_hits":{"collpased_docs":{"hits":{"total":1,"max_score":1.4586792,"hits":[{"_index":"gopa-index","_type":"doc","_id":"e561d8af12854a343b559cbc560eca3d","_score":1.4586792,"_source":{"host":"defence.gov.au","snapshot":{"content_type":"text/html","created":"2018-09-27T21:46:14.642766527Z","description":"\nAt a glance.

Given the substantial distances over which the Australian Defence Force (ADF) must operate â nationally, regionally and globally â air and sea lift capabilities are essential. A flexible force of air and sea lift capabilities will enable the ADF to reach, resupply and sustain missions in different locations. The ADF also needs to have lift capacity to be highly mobile within any area of operation.\nKey air and sea lift capabilities\nThe ADFâs strategic transport capability will be greatly enhanced through the already delivered acquisition of two additional heavyâlift Câ17A Globemaster transport aircraft, capable of moving large cargo and numbers of personnel great distances, such as from Australia to the Middle East, increasing our fleet to eight aircraft. Additional heavy lift aircraft will be considered at a later stage.\nThe Government will extend the range of combat and surveillance aircraft, acquiring two additional KCâ30A airâtoâair refuellers before the end of this decade for a total of seven aircraft. Expanding the fleet to nine aircraft in the longer term will be considered to meet increasing demand.\nOur Chinook helicopters are a workhorse of the ADF, capable of moving stores and personnel, including vehicles and artillery around the battlefield or from ships to the land without the need for an airfield as well as undertaking aeroâmedical evacuation. The Government will acquire three additional CHâ47F Chinook heavyâlift helicopters in the near term to expand battlefield lift capacity and support tactical missions including aeroâmedical evacuation for a total of 10 helicopters.\nThe logistics support ship, HMAS Choules, and the two Canberra Class amphibious ships, will provide scalable and flexible options for greater capacity sea lift and amphibious operations. The Government will extend the life of HMAS Choules and update the capabilities onboard, including modern self defence and aviation support systems until it is replaced around 2030.\nIn addition, the Government will acquire a new large hulled multiâpurpose patrol vessel, the Australian Defence Vessel Ocean Protector for the Navy to support border protection and maritime resource security related tasks with the Australian Border Force.\nSustainment of our maritime capabilities will be improved by two new replenishment vessels that will begin service by 2026. The vessels will provide naval combat units with fuel, water and stores while underway at sea. A third replenishment vessel or additional logistics support ship will be acquired the late 2020s.\nTogether, HMAS\nChoules\n, the amphibious ships, and replenishment vessels, will enable the ADF to conduct a greater number of challenging maritime operations at the same time, and to sustain those operations for longer periods than we can today.\nThe Government will acquire enhanced aeroâmedical evacuation and search and rescue capabilities for our forces, with upgrades to aeroâmedical equipment for the Chinook helicopters commencing from 2016. In the longer term, options will be investigated for a dedicated longârange combat search and rescue capability.\nThe Government will upgrade the 12 Câ130J Hercules medium transport aircraft to ensure that they can continue to fulfil their critical role in moving stores and equipment within our region when required.\n10 Câ27J Spartan medium transport aircraft are currently being introduced into service. The Spartans will enhance the ADFâs air lift capability, providing a unique capacity to move personnel and small cargos to remote locations using shorter landing strips not suitable for any other fixed wing military aircraft in the ADF fleet.\nThe MRHâ90 Troop lift helicopter will continue to be introduced into service, with Army to operate 39 to 41 aircraft and Navy to operate up to eight aircraft. The aircraft will be a force multiplier for Army in tactical air mobility and for Navy in maritime support. Current plans include a requirement for roleâspecific upgrades to the MRHâ90 Troop lift helicopter to replace the Sâ70A Blackhawk in support of domestic counter terrorism operations.\nPeople\nAn additional around 800 ADF positions will be allocated to 2025â26 to assist with the air and sea lift fleets, including introduction of the two additional heavy lift Câ17A Globemaster transport aircraft, two additional airâtoâair refuelling aircraft, 10 Câ27J Spartan medium transport aircraft, two new replenishment vessels, and three additional CHâ47 Chinook heavyâlift helicopters.\nInfrastructure\nSubstantial investment in support of air lift is programmed for upgraded infrastructure at RAAF Base Amberley, Queensland, including facilities to support an increased number of tactical, medium and strategic lift aircraft. Funding is also programmed at RAAF Base Richmond, New South Wales, in the latter years of the decade to 2025â26.\nAustraliaâs growing sea lift capability will be supported by planned upgrades to wharves and port facilities, including substantial investment in Fleet Base East, combined with continued commercial arrangements for ADF access to civilian infrastructure.\nDefence Service \u0026 Personnel Records\nFreedom of Information\nInformation Publication Scheme\nPopular publications\nAnnual reports\nBudget\nDefence White Paper\nFOI Disclosures\nInquiry Reports\nPay \u0026 Conditions Manual\nPublications\nIn focus\nPathway to Change\nFighting Fit - ADF Health Portal\nAnzac Centenary\nAnzac Day\nFirst Principles Review\nReport Abuse and Misconduct\nSeMPRO : Victim focused\nFamily and Domestic Violence\nLike the website?\nWe welcome you to take our 20 second survey and help us improve the site.\n \nFeedback\n \nMinister for Defence\nHome page\nBiography\nMedia releases\nSpeeches\nTranscripts\nDefence Service \u0026 Personnel Records\nFreedom of Information\nInformation Publication Scheme\nPopular publications\nAnnual reports\nBudget\nDefence White Paper\nFOI Disclosures\nInquiry Reports\nPay \u0026 Conditions Manual\nPublications\nIn focus\nPathway to Change\nFighting Fit - ADF Health Portal\nAnzac Centenary\nAnzac Day\nFirst Principles Review\nReport Abuse and Misconduct\nSeMPRO : Victim focused\nFamily and Domestic Violence\nLike the website?\nWe welcome you to take our 20 second survey and help us improve the site.\n \nFeedback\n \nMinister for Defence\nHome page\nBiography\nMedia releases\nSpeeches\nTranscripts\nDefending Australia and its National Interests\nContact us\nCopyright\nDisclaimer\nPrivacy\nAccessibility\nSitemap\nError/bug\nToggle responsive view\nBack to top\n","title":"   \t  Air and Sea Lift Capability : At a Glance       : Department of Defence","url":"http://defence.gov.au/Whitepaper/AtAGlance/Air-Sea-Lift.asp","version":1},"task":{"breadth":0,"created":"2018-09-27T21:43:55.533838966Z","depth":0,"host":"defence.gov.au","id":"bemku6ot87468b6omfag","last_check":"2018-09-27T21:46:14.820064928Z","last_fetch":"2018-09-27T21:46:14.642788256Z","next_check":"2018-09-27T21:56:14.820064928Z","original_url":"http://defence.gov.au/Whitepaper/AtAGlance/Air-Sea-Lift.asp","reference_url":"http://defence.gov.au/WhitePaper/","schema":"http","snapshot_created":"2018-09-27T21:46:14.642766527Z","snapshot_hash":"e51262c05664c75bd843b243e177eb7dc9fcc504","snapshot_id":"bemkv9gt8746bdj87o80","snapshot_version":1,"status":3,"updated":"2018-09-27T21:46:14.465695344Z","url":"http://defence.gov.au/Whitepaper/AtAGlance/Air-Sea-Lift.asp"}}}]}}}},{"_index":"gopa-index","_type":"doc","_id":"e2edd4c2a6d14fd3a1088a57da104e74","_score":1.4586792,"_source":{"host":"defence.gov.au","snapshot":{"content_type":"text/html","created":"2018-09-27T21:46:14.757960453Z","description":"\nAt a glance.

The Defence Industry Policy Statement provides the foundation to take the partnerships between Defence and industry to new levels of cooperation, with a focus on stronger, more strategic\npartnerships and closer alignment between industry investment and Defence capability needs. Initiatives in the Defence Industry Policy Statement will see the development of a technologically advanced, innovationâdriven and sustainable Australian defence industrial base, which is well placed to assist Defence in protecting Australiaâs national interests.\nDelivering Defence Capability\nThe Governmentâs 10âyear Defence budget plan to 2025â26 grows the Defence budget from $32.4 billion in 2016â17 to $58.7 billion in 2025â26, providing an additional $29.9 billion to Defence over this period than previously planned. The Government will invest approximately $195 billion in Defence capability to 2025â26, restoring confidence in Defenceâs long term funding.\nFor the first time, the 2016 Integrated Investment Program released with the Defence White Paper brings together all elements of Defence investment, including equipment, facilities, workforce, and information and communications technology as well as major weapons, platforms and systems. Australian industry now has the clarity and certainty to invest in the people and infrastructure to make these capability plans a reality.\nThe 2016 Defence Industry Policy Statement, the First Principles Review and the Governmentâs decisions on naval shipbuilding, reinforce the importance of treating Australian industry as a fundamental input to capability. It will be mandatory for Defence to consider Australian industry in the formal capability development process. This will help industry to better match specialist skills and advances in science and technology to develop innovative solutions for new capabilities.\nStrategic Partnership with Industry\nThe Government places a high priority on maximising the innovation potential of the Australian economy. Innovation will be reâpositioned as an essential driver to generate new capabilities for Defence and new opportunities for Australian industry. The Governmentâs Defence Industry Policy Statement complements the 2015 National Innovation and Science Agenda, with a focus on maximising the delivery of Defence capability through a more focused, coordinated and transparent effort between Defence and industry. The Statement will transform Defenceâs approach to innovation, and create a seamless link between capability needs, smart ideas and innovation in Australian industry. New initiatives will harness Australiaâs potential for innovation by streamlining engagement with industry, academic and research organisations, and by establishing a single endâtoend\ninnovation pipeline with a clear path to commercialisation.\nHarnessing Australian Innovation in the Defence Sector\nThe Government is committed to maximising opportunities for competitive Australian businesses; building export potential, depth of skills and diversification for defence industry, and cutting red tape to make it simpler and less costly for Australian industry to support Defence.\nThe initiatives in this Statement will bring Defence and industry closer together and drive the changes we need to ensure industry becomes more competitive and highly skilled, and to encourage investment both at the local and international level.\nThe new Defence Industry Policy Statement centres on two key initiatives: the Centre for Defence Industry Capability and a new approach to Defence innovation. These initiatives will deliver around $1.6 billion in investment in Defenceârelated innovation to 2025â26, supporting Australian science and technology and innovation to provide advanced homeâgrown Defence capabilities.\nThe Centre for Defence Industry Capability will be funded at around $230 million to 2025â26. The Centre will promote defence industry competitiveness, guide the priorities across defence industry, and connect Defence capability with innovation.\nAround $730 million to 2025â26 will be provided for research on next generation technologies with the potential to deliver gameâchanging capabilities critical to defence and national security.\nThe Defence Innovation Hub (the Hub) will be a virtual network, funded at around $640 million to 2025â26 to bring together Defenceâs innovation programs. The Hub will enable defence industry to collaborate on innovation efforts that deliver a capability edge throughout the capability life cycle from initial concept, through prototyping and testing to introduction into service.\nThe Defence Innovation Portal, as part of the Centre for Defence Industry Capability, will be a key communication bridge between Defence, industry and academia, providing vital connections between small to medium enterprises and Defence.\nA Strong and Sustainable Australian Naval Shipbuilding Industry\nA strong, viable and sustainable Australian naval shipbuilding industry is a vital element of Australiaâs defence capability to manage Australiaâs strategic challenges to 2035. The Government is delivering a longâterm plan to ensure retention of a sovereign Australian naval shipbuilding industry and the jobs that go with it. The Governmentâs strategy is centred on a longâterm continuous build of major warships and minor naval vessels in Australia.\nIn the short term, the continuous build strategy will sustain around 1,000 jobs that would otherwise have been lost, and will guarantee around 2,500 longâterm Australian surface shipbuilding jobs for decades to come. This strategy will transform Australiaâs shipbuilding industry and put an end to the boomâbust cycle that has afflicted the industry, and has led to the current shipbuilding âvalley of deathâ. The Government is confident in the ability of Australian defence industry to play its part in moving to a continuous build program for naval surface ships, which will require unprecedented reform of the Australian naval shipbuilding industry focused on significant improvements in productivity.\nDefence Service \u0026 Personnel Records\nFreedom of Information\nInformation Publication Scheme\nPopular publications\nAnnual reports\nBudget\nDefence White Paper\nFOI Disclosures\nInquiry Reports\nPay \u0026 Conditions Manual\nPublications\nIn focus\nPathway to Change\nFighting Fit - ADF Health Portal\nAnzac Centenary\nAnzac Day\nFirst Principles Review\nReport Abuse and Misconduct\nSeMPRO : Victim focused\nFamily and Domestic Violence\nLike the website?\nWe welcome you to take our 20 second survey and help us improve the site.\n \nFeedback\n \nMinister for Defence\nHome page\nBiography\nMedia releases\nSpeeches\nTranscripts\nDefence Service \u0026 Personnel Records\nFreedom of Information\nInformation Publication Scheme\nPopular publications\nAnnual reports\nBudget\nDefence White Paper\nFOI Disclosures\nInquiry Reports\nPay \u0026 Conditions Manual\nPublications\nIn focus\nPathway to Change\nFighting Fit - ADF Health Portal\nAnzac Centenary\nAnzac Day\nFirst Principles Review\nReport Abuse and Misconduct\nSeMPRO : Victim focused\nFamily and Domestic Violence\nLike the website?\nWe welcome you to take our 20 second survey and help us improve the site.\n \nFeedback\n \nMinister for Defence\nHome page\nBiography\nMedia releases\nSpeeches\nTranscripts\nDefending Australia and its National Interests\nContact us\nCopyright\nDisclaimer\nPrivacy\nAccessibility\nSitemap\nError/bug\nToggle responsive view\nBack to top\n","title":"   \t  Defence Industry : At a Glance       : Department of Defence","url":"http://defence.gov.au/Whitepaper/AtAGlance/Defence-Industry.asp","version":1},"task":{"breadth":0,"created":"2018-09-27T21:43:55.534336782Z","depth":0,"host":"defence.gov.au","id":"bemku6ot87468b6omfc0","last_check":"2018-09-27T21:46:15.027530355Z","last_fetch":"2018-09-27T21:46:14.757990215Z","next_check":"2018-09-27T21:56:15.027530355Z","original_url":"http://defence.gov.au/Whitepaper/AtAGlance/Defence-Industry.asp","reference_url":"http://defence.gov.au/WhitePaper/","schema":"http","snapshot_created":"2018-09-27T21:46:14.757960453Z","snapshot_hash":"79ffecfdb17899acfdb55d81696e06a8384a7d85","snapshot_id":"bemkv9gt8746bdj87oag","snapshot_version":1,"status":3,"updated":"2018-09-27T21:46:14.703613283Z","url":"http://defence.gov.au/Whitepaper/AtAGlance/Defence-Industry.asp"}},"fields":{"snapshot.title.keyword":["   \t  Defence Industry : At a Glance       : Department of Defence"]},"inner_hits":{"collpased_docs":{"hits":{"total":1,"max_score":1.4586792,"hits":[{"_index":"gopa-index","_type":"doc","_id":"e2edd4c2a6d14fd3a1088a57da104e74","_score":1.4586792,"_source":{"host":"defence.gov.au","snapshot":{"content_type":"text/html","created":"2018-09-27T21:46:14.757960453Z","description":"\nAt a glance.

Initiatives in the Defence Industry Policy Statement will see the development of a technologically advanced, innovationâdriven and sustainable Australian defence industrial base, which is well placed to assist Defence in protecting Australiaâs national interests.\nDelivering Defence Capability\nThe Governmentâs 10âyear Defence budget plan to 2025â26 grows the Defence budget from $32.4 billion in 2016â17 to $58.7 billion in 2025â26, providing an additional $29.9 billion to Defence over this period than previously planned. The Government will invest approximately $195 billion in Defence capability to 2025â26, restoring confidence in Defenceâs long term funding.\nFor the first time, the 2016 Integrated Investment Program released with the Defence White Paper brings together all elements of Defence investment, including equipment, facilities, workforce, and information and communications technology as well as major weapons, platforms and systems. Australian industry now has the clarity and certainty to invest in the people and infrastructure to make these capability plans a reality.\nThe 2016 Defence Industry Policy Statement, the First Principles Review and the Governmentâs decisions on naval shipbuilding, reinforce the importance of treating Australian industry as a fundamental input to capability. It will be mandatory for Defence to consider Australian industry in the formal capability development process. This will help industry to better match specialist skills and advances in science and technology to develop innovative solutions for new capabilities.\nStrategic Partnership with Industry\nThe Government places a high priority on maximising the innovation potential of the Australian economy. Innovation will be reâpositioned as an essential driver to generate new capabilities for Defence and new opportunities for Australian industry. The Governmentâs Defence Industry Policy Statement complements the 2015 National Innovation and Science Agenda, with a focus on maximising the delivery of Defence capability through a more focused, coordinated and transparent effort between Defence and industry. The Statement will transform Defenceâs approach to innovation, and create a seamless link between capability needs, smart ideas and innovation in Australian industry. New initiatives will harness Australiaâs potential for innovation by streamlining engagement with industry, academic and research organisations, and by establishing a single endâtoend\ninnovation pipeline with a clear path to commercialisation.\nHarnessing Australian Innovation in the Defence Sector\nThe Government is committed to maximising opportunities for competitive Australian businesses; building export potential, depth of skills and diversification for defence industry, and cutting red tape to make it simpler and less costly for Australian industry to support Defence.\nThe initiatives in this Statement will bring Defence and industry closer together and drive the changes we need to ensure industry becomes more competitive and highly skilled, and to encourage investment both at the local and international level.\nThe new Defence Industry Policy Statement centres on two key initiatives: the Centre for Defence Industry Capability and a new approach to Defence innovation. These initiatives will deliver around $1.6 billion in investment in Defenceârelated innovation to 2025â26, supporting Australian science and technology and innovation to provide advanced homeâgrown Defence capabilities.\nThe Centre for Defence Industry Capability will be funded at around $230 million to 2025â26. The Centre will promote defence industry competitiveness, guide the priorities across defence industry, and connect Defence capability with innovation.\nAround $730 million to 2025â26 will be provided for research on next generation technologies with the potential to deliver gameâchanging capabilities critical to defence and national security.\nThe Defence Innovation Hub (the Hub) will be a virtual network, funded at around $640 million to 2025â26 to bring together Defenceâs innovation programs. The Hub will enable defence industry to collaborate on innovation efforts that deliver a capability edge throughout the capability life cycle from initial concept, through prototyping and testing to introduction into service.\nThe Defence Innovation Portal, as part of the Centre for Defence Industry Capability, will be a key communication bridge between Defence, industry and academia, providing vital connections between small to medium enterprises and Defence.\nA Strong and Sustainable Australian Naval Shipbuilding Industry\nA strong, viable and sustainable Australian naval shipbuilding industry is a vital element of Australiaâs defence capability to manage Australiaâs strategic challenges to 2035. The Government is delivering a longâterm plan to ensure retention of a sovereign Australian naval shipbuilding industry and the jobs that go with it. The Governmentâs strategy is centred on a longâterm continuous build of major warships and minor naval vessels in Australia.\nIn the short term, the continuous build strategy will sustain around 1,000 jobs that would otherwise have been lost, and will guarantee around 2,500 longâterm Australian surface shipbuilding jobs for decades to come. This strategy will transform Australiaâs shipbuilding industry and put an end to the boomâbust cycle that has afflicted the industry, and has led to the current shipbuilding âvalley of deathâ. The Government is confident in the ability of Australian defence industry to play its part in moving to a continuous build program for naval surface ships, which will require unprecedented reform of the Australian naval shipbuilding industry focused on significant improvements in productivity.\nDefence Service \u0026 Personnel Records\nFreedom of Information\nInformation Publication Scheme\nPopular publications\nAnnual reports\nBudget\nDefence White Paper\nFOI Disclosures\nInquiry Reports\nPay \u0026 Conditions Manual\nPublications\nIn focus\nPathway to Change\nFighting Fit -

The Government will invest around 18 percent of Defence capital expenditure to 2025â26 in our land combat and amphibious warfare capabilities through greater situational awareness, firepower, protection, mobility and force sustainability. These enhancements will increase Australiaâs capacity for both combat and noncombat operations, including for security and stabilisation operations and the provision of humanitarian assistance and disaster relief.\nKey land combat and amphibious warfare capabilities\nAustralian soldiers will continue to receive the worldâclass equipment, weapons systems and protection they need to undertake their important roles. Key weapons systems to be acquired include: new rifles and pistols; direct fire support weapons, including those used against armoured vehicles, bunkers and installations; and indirect weapons such as mortars. New improved personal protection equipment will be acquired, such as body armour, nightâfighting equipment, and protective equipment to mitigate chemical, biological and radiological threats. Defence will continuously monitor, adapt and improve the personal equipment and weapons systems to respond quickly to evolving operational requirements.\nNew combat reconnaissance, infantry fighting, new generation armoured and protected mobility fleets and upgrades to the M1 Abrams Main Battle Tanks will ensure our forces have the protection, mobility and firepower they need to defeat potential adversaries on the future battlefield. On 5 October, 2015, the Government announced acquisition of 1,100 locally built Hawkei protected vehicles and over 1,000 trailers.\nOur land forces will have unprecedented knowledge of what is happening around them and the firepower to respond. A new armed intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR) unmanned aircraft capability is programmed for the early 2020s, to facilitate the timely delivery of accurate information to commanders at all levels, and provide superior situational awareness to inform decisionâmaking. This capability will enhance the Australian Defence Forceâs counterâterrorism support capability overseas and could augment search and rescue, humanitarian assistance and disaster relief and coastal surveillance. New small unmanned aircraft will provide better realâtime ISR support to tactical commanders.\nA new long range rocket system will be acquired in the midâ2020s to provide additional firepower at greater distances (up to around 300km) to complement our existing artillery capability. Our 22 Tiger Armed Reconnaissance helicopters, which provide firepower for our land force operations, will be replaced from the mid 2020s by manned or unmanned systems, or a combination of both, depending on technological developments.\nNew protected and unprotected engineering platforms including cranes, excavators, front end loaders, forklifts, and tractors; armoured bridging and breaching platforms; aviation and fire trucks; and other support capabilities will be acquired over the next decade to support our forces.\nBattlefield logistic support to our troops will be enhanced, including deployable logistics information systems, and replacement of maritime transport vessels. A riverine patrol capability will be reâestablished through a fleet of lightly armed boats from around 2022 to allow operations in estuarine environments. New deployable land communication networks, including satellite and terrestrial communications, will equip our forces with the communications capabilities they need for future operations.\nAmphibious capability\nAustraliaâs strengthened amphibious capability centres around our new\nCanberra\nClass amphibious ships, which will provide the ADF with an unprecedented capability to conduct a wide range of operations in the maritime environment. These amphibious ships will enable the ADF to land a sizeable force of personnel and equipment across a broad spectrum of operations. The\nCanberra\nClass shipsâ onâboard hospital and their ability to operate without wharves or port infrastructure will be a major asset in support of both domestic and international disaster recovery missions. Over time, the capability of the ships will be enhanced to better support joint command and control, including upgrades to communications and intelligence systems and semiâautonomous self defence capabilities. In the longer term, we will replace the shipsâ landing craft used to transport people and equipment from ship to shore. Together with our logistics support ship, HMAS\nChoules\n, the amphibious ships will provide scalable and flexible options for amphibious operations and sea lift.\nSpecial Forces\nAustraliaâs Special Forces undertake complex tactical operations across a range of combat environments. This includes a range of specialist response options when deployed overseas, such as supporting air strikes, reconnaissance and rescue missions. Special Forces are also responsible for domestic counterâterrorism roles when required. Our capability will be significantly enhanced with new highâend weapons, improved mission command networks and situational awareness tools, enhanced tactical mobility, specialised force protection, and logistic support capabilities. The Government will also deliver a new fleet of light helicopters (which are rapidly deployable by transport aircraft) from the midâ2020s to enhance mobility for special operations missions.\nPeople\nAround 700 additional ADF positions will be allocated to 2025â26 to support our strengthened land combat and amphibious warfare capabilities.\nInfrastructure\nWe will upgrade bases including in Brisbane, Darwin, Sydney, Puckapunyal in Victoria, and Townsville, and weapon ranges and training areas such as Puckapunyal and Shoalwater Bay, Queensland to 2025â26. Upgrades to HMAS Stirling in Perth and Fleet Base East (Garden Island) in Sydney will support the amphibious ships. New facilities will support new unmanned aircraft, including at Royal Australian Air Force bases Townsville and Tindal, Northern Territory; Shoalwater Bay; and at the Cultana and Woomera ranges in South Australia.\nDefence Service \u0026 Personnel Records\nFreedom of Information\nInformation Publication Scheme\nPopular publications\nAnnual reports\nBudget\nDefence White Paper\nFOI Disclosures\nInquiry Reports\nPay \u0026 Conditions Manual\nPublications\nIn focus\nPathway to Change\nFighting Fit - ADF Health Portal\nAnzac Centenary\nAnzac Day\nFirst Principles Review\nReport Abuse and Misconduct\nSeMPRO : Victim focused\nFamily and Domestic Violence\nLike the website?\nWe welcome you to take our 20 second survey and help us improve the site.\n \nFeedback\n \nMinister for Defence\nHome page\nBiography\nMedia releases\nSpeeches\nTranscripts\nDefence Service \u0026 Personnel Records\nFreedom of Information\nInformation Publication Scheme\nPopular publications\nAnnual reports\nBudget\nDefence White Paper\nFOI Disclosures\nInquiry Reports\nPay \u0026 Conditions Manual\nPublications\nIn focus\nPathway to Change\nFighting Fit - ADF Health Portal\nAnzac Centenary\nAnzac Day\nFirst Principles Review\nReport Abuse and Misconduct\nSeMPRO : Victim focused\nFamily and Domestic Violence\nLike the website?\nWe welcome you to take our 20 second survey and help us improve the site.\n \nFeedback\n \nMinister for Defence\nHome page\nBiography\nMedia releases\nSpeeches\nTranscripts\nDefending Australia and its National Interests\nContact us\nCopyright\nDisclaimer\nPrivacy\nAccessibility\nSitemap\nError/bug\nToggle responsive view\nBack to top\n","title":"   \t  Land Combat and Amphibious Warfare : At a Glance       : Department of Defence","url":"http://defence.gov.au/Whitepaper/AtAGlance/Land-Combat-Amphib.asp","version":1},"task":{"breadth":0,"created":"2018-09-27T21:43:56.019505784Z","depth":0,"host":"defence.gov.au","id":"bemku70t87468b6omfug","last_check":"2018-09-27T21:46:16.340332338Z","last_fetch":"2018-09-27T21:46:15.992110815Z","next_check":"2018-09-27T21:56:16.340332338Z","original_url":"http://defence.gov.au/Whitepaper/AtAGlance/Land-Combat-Amphib.asp","reference_url":"http://defence.gov.au/WhitePaper/","schema":"http","snapshot_created":"2018-09-27T21:46:15.992087233Z","snapshot_hash":"5a6fcbcdfc8e99f5dfe274fb65b632614c01b22e","snapshot_id":"bemkv9ot8746bdj87u5g","snapshot_version":1,"status":3,"updated":"2018-09-27T21:46:15.982759857Z","url":"http://defence.gov.au/Whitepaper/AtAGlance/Land-Combat-Amphib.asp"}},"fields":{"snapshot.title.keyword":["   \t  Land Combat and Amphibious Warfare : At a Glance       : Department of Defence"]},"inner_hits":{"collpased_docs":{"hits":{"total":1,"max_score":1.3814803,"hits":[{"_index":"gopa-index","_type":"doc","_id":"bd8dd3363ee9467e934451bb904a5425","_score":1.3814803,"_source":{"host":"defence.gov.au","snapshot":{"content_type":"text/html","created":"2018-09-27T21:46:15.992087233Z","description":"\nAt a glance.

The Government will invest around 18 percent of Defence capital expenditure to 2025â26 in our land combat and amphibious warfare capabilities through greater situational awareness, firepower, protection, mobility and force sustainability. These enhancements will increase Australiaâs capacity for both combat and noncombat operations, including for security and stabilisation operations and the provision of humanitarian assistance and disaster relief.\nKey land combat and amphibious warfare capabilities\nAustralian soldiers will continue to receive the worldâclass equipment, weapons systems and protection they need to undertake their important roles. Key weapons systems to be acquired include: new rifles and pistols; direct fire support weapons, including those used against armoured vehicles, bunkers and installations; and indirect weapons such as mortars. New improved personal protection equipment will be acquired, such as body armour, nightâfighting equipment, and protective equipment to mitigate chemical, biological and radiological threats. Defence will continuously monitor, adapt and improve the personal equipment and weapons systems to respond quickly to evolving operational requirements.\nNew combat reconnaissance, infantry fighting, new generation armoured and protected mobility fleets and upgrades to the M1 Abrams Main Battle Tanks will ensure our forces have the protection, mobility and firepower they need to defeat potential adversaries on the future battlefield. On 5 October, 2015, the Government announced acquisition of 1,100 locally built Hawkei protected vehicles and over 1,000 trailers.\nOur land forces will have unprecedented knowledge of what is happening around them and the firepower to respond. A new armed intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR) unmanned aircraft capability is programmed for the early 2020s, to facilitate the timely delivery of accurate information to commanders at all levels, and provide superior situational awareness to inform decisionâmaking. This capability will enhance the Australian Defence Forceâs counterâterrorism support capability overseas and could augment search and rescue, humanitarian assistance and disaster relief and coastal surveillance. New small unmanned aircraft will provide better realâtime ISR support to tactical commanders.\nA new long range rocket system will be acquired in the midâ2020s to provide additional firepower at greater distances (up to around 300km) to complement our existing artillery capability. Our 22 Tiger Armed Reconnaissance helicopters, which provide firepower for our land force operations, will be replaced from the mid 2020s by manned or unmanned systems, or a combination of both, depending on technological developments.\nNew protected and unprotected engineering platforms including cranes, excavators, front end loaders, forklifts, and tractors; armoured bridging and breaching platforms; aviation and fire trucks; and other support capabilities will be acquired over the next decade to support our forces.\nBattlefield logistic support to our troops will be enhanced, including deployable logistics information systems, and replacement of maritime transport vessels. A riverine patrol capability will be reâestablished through a fleet of lightly armed boats from around 2022 to allow operations in estuarine environments. New deployable land communication networks, including satellite and terrestrial communications, will equip our forces with the communications capabilities they need for future operations.\nAmphibious capability\nAustraliaâs strengthened amphibious capability centres around our new\nCanberra\nClass amphibious ships, which will provide the ADF with an unprecedented capability to conduct a wide range of operations in the maritime environment. These amphibious ships will enable the ADF to land a sizeable force of personnel and equipment across a broad spectrum of operations. The\nCanberra\nClass shipsâ onâboard hospital and their ability to operate without wharves or port infrastructure will be a major asset in support of both domestic and international disaster recovery missions. Over time, the capability of the ships will be enhanced to better support joint command and control, including upgrades to communications and intelligence systems and semiâautonomous self defence capabilities. In the longer term, we will replace the shipsâ landing craft used to transport people and equipment from ship to shore. Together with our logistics support ship, HMAS\nChoules\n, the amphibious ships will provide scalable and flexible options for amphibious operations and sea lift.\nSpecial Forces\nAustraliaâs Special Forces undertake complex tactical operations across a range of combat environments. This includes a range of specialist response options when deployed overseas, such as supporting air strikes, reconnaissance and rescue missions. Special Forces are also responsible for domestic counterâterrorism roles when required. Our capability will be significantly enhanced with new highâend weapons, improved mission command networks and situational awareness tools, enhanced tactical mobility, specialised force protection, and logistic support capabilities. The Government will also deliver a new fleet of light helicopters (which are rapidly deployable by transport aircraft) from the midâ2020s to enhance mobility for special operations missions.\nPeople\nAround 700 additional ADF positions will be allocated to 2025â26 to support our strengthened land combat and amphibious warfare capabilities.\nInfrastructure\nWe will upgrade bases including in Brisbane, Darwin, Sydney, Puckapunyal in Victoria, and Townsville, and weapon ranges and training areas such as Puckapunyal and Shoalwater Bay, Queensland to 2025â26. Upgrades to HMAS Stirling in Perth and Fleet Base East (Garden Island) in Sydney will support the amphibious ships.

The Government will invest around 25 percent of Defence capital expenditure to 2025â26 in our maritime capabilities in the most comprehensive regeneration of our Navy since the Second World War. Our maritime forces will become more potent out to the 2030s through more capable submarines, ships and aircraft and better integration of combat and supporting systems across Defence. This will enable our forces to protect our maritime borders and resources, secure our immediate northern approaches and proximate sea lines of communication, and project force in the maritime environment.\nKey maritime operations and antiâsubmarine warfare capabilities\nThe future submarine program is the largest defence procurement in Australiaâs history. A fleet of 12 new regionally superior submarines with a high degree of interoperability with the United States will replace the six current\nCollins\nClass submarines. The new submarines will provide an essential element of Australiaâs deterrent capability. The key roles of the future submarine will include: antiâsubmarine warfare; antiâsurface vessel warfare; intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance; and support to special operations. The results of the competitive evaluation process will be announced this year. The\nCollins\nClass submarine fleet will continue to be supported and upgraded to ensure that it remains a potent capability through the rest of its life and until transition to the new submarine.\nThe new submarines will likely begin to enter service in the early 2030s, with delivery extending over two decades to around 2050. A rolling acquisition program for Australiaâs future submarines will ensure that Australia is able to maintain a fleet of 12 regionally superior submarines as submarine and antiâsubmarine technologies develop over time. As part of a rolling acquisition program, a review of strategic circumstances and developments in submarine technology will be conducted in the late 2020s to consider whether the configuration of the submarines remains suitable or whether consideration of other specifications should commence. A rolling program of acquiring submarines will provide longâterm planning certainty for Australian industry, allowing companies to invest in the capabilities needed to support their involvement in the construction and sustainment activities.\nNine new antiâsubmarine warfare frigates will be introduced into service from the late 2020s, with construction to start in 2020, to replace the existing fleet of eight ANZAC Class frigates. The new frigates will have the range and endurance to operate throughout maritime South East Asia and be deployable from forward bases, such as in the Middle East. They will be equipped with offensive and selfâprotection systems.\nTwelve new offshore patrol vessels (OPV) will begin entering service from the early 2020s, with construction to start in 2018, replacing the 13\nArmidale\nClass patrol boats. The OPVs will have greater reach, endurance and capacity than the\nArmidale\nClass patrol boat fleet, allowing them to perform a broader range of border protection and patrol missions.\nAustraliaâs maritime surveillance and response capability will be significantly enhanced through the Governmentâs acquisition of seven additional Pâ8A Poseidon maritime surveillance and response aircraft to be acquired in two tranches for a total of 15 by the late 2020s. In addition to their sophisticated surveillance capabilities, these aircraft can undertake offensive operations against submarines and ships, as well as supporting search and rescue operations.\nTo improve our shipsâ situational awareness on operations, a new maritime tactical unmanned aircraft will also be delivered over the next decade. The tactical unmanned aircraft will be deployable on a range of Royal Australian Navy vessels including the OPVs and antiâsubmarine warfare frigates.\nAustraliaâs military hydrography capability provides sailors with precision measurement of the physical features of the oceans and water mass. The current fleet of two large and four smaller ADF hydrographic survey vessels will be progressively retired from around the early 2020s. Defence will replace this capability with an efficient combination of military and commercial hydrographic and oceanographic survey capabilities to deliver the required capacity.\nThree\nHobart\nClass Air Warfare Destroyers will be in service by the early 2020s. To ensure these vessels can keep pace with regional capabilities, upgrades will be made to the AEGIS combat system, weapons, selfâprotection and intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance systems throughout their service life. The vessels will provide Australian and coalition maritime task with defence against air and missile attack.\n24 MHâ60R Seahawk naval combat helicopters are currently being accepted into service. They will enhance the\nHobart\nClass Air Warfare Destroyersâ and\nANZAC\nClass Frigatesâ antiâship and antiâsubmarine warfare operations. A maritime fleet of up to eight MRHâ90 helicopters will support the amphibious and replenishment ship fleet.\nEnhancements to Defenceâs maritime capabilities will provide Australia with enhanced situational awareness of activities in our maritime domain, earlier detection of emerging threats to our border security and faster responses to deter and defeat any such threat.\nPeople\nAn additional around 800 ADF positions will be allocated to 2025â26 to support the substantially larger maritime force.

The Government will invest around 25 percent of Defence capital expenditure to 2025â26 in our maritime capabilities in the most comprehensive regeneration of our Navy since the Second World War. Our maritime forces will become more potent out to the 2030s through more capable submarines, ships and aircraft and better integration of combat and supporting systems across Defence. This will enable our forces to protect our maritime borders and resources, secure our immediate northern approaches and proximate sea lines of communication, and project force in the maritime environment.\nKey maritime operations and antiâsubmarine warfare capabilities\nThe future submarine program is the largest defence procurement in Australiaâs history. A fleet of 12 new regionally superior submarines with a high degree of interoperability with the United States will replace the six current\nCollins\nClass submarines. The new submarines will provide an essential element of Australiaâs deterrent capability. The key roles of the future submarine will include: antiâsubmarine warfare; antiâsurface vessel warfare; intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance; and support to special operations. The results of the competitive evaluation process will be announced this year. The\nCollins\nClass submarine fleet will continue to be supported and upgraded to ensure that it remains a potent capability through the rest of its life and until transition to the new submarine.\nThe new submarines will likely begin to enter service in the early 2030s, with delivery extending over two decades to around 2050. A rolling acquisition program for Australiaâs future submarines will ensure that Australia is able to maintain a fleet of 12 regionally superior submarines as submarine and antiâsubmarine technologies develop over time. As part of a rolling acquisition program, a review of strategic circumstances and developments in submarine technology will be conducted in the late 2020s to consider whether the configuration of the submarines remains suitable or whether consideration of other specifications should commence. A rolling program of acquiring submarines will provide longâterm planning certainty for Australian industry, allowing companies to invest in the capabilities needed to support their involvement in the construction and sustainment activities.\nNine new antiâsubmarine warfare frigates will be introduced into service from the late 2020s, with construction to start in 2020, to replace the existing fleet of eight ANZAC Class frigates. The new frigates will have the range and endurance to operate throughout maritime South East Asia and be deployable from forward bases, such as in the Middle East. They will be equipped with offensive and selfâprotection systems.\nTwelve new offshore patrol vessels (OPV) will begin entering service from the early 2020s, with construction to start in 2018, replacing the 13\nArmidale\nClass patrol boats. The OPVs will have greater reach, endurance and capacity than the\nArmidale\nClass patrol boat fleet, allowing them to perform a broader range of border protection and patrol missions.\nAustraliaâs maritime surveillance and response capability will be significantly enhanced through the Governmentâs acquisition of seven additional Pâ8A Poseidon maritime surveillance and response aircraft to be acquired in two tranches for a total of 15 by the late 2020s. In addition to their sophisticated surveillance capabilities, these aircraft can undertake offensive operations against submarines and ships, as well as supporting search and rescue operations.\nTo improve our shipsâ situational awareness on operations, a new maritime tactical unmanned aircraft will also be delivered over the next decade. The tactical unmanned aircraft will be deployable on a range of Royal Australian Navy vessels including the OPVs and antiâsubmarine warfare frigates.\nAustraliaâs military hydrography capability provides sailors with precision measurement of the physical features of the oceans and water mass. The current fleet of two large and four smaller ADF hydrographic survey vessels will be progressively retired from around the early 2020s. Defence will replace this capability with an efficient combination of military and commercial hydrographic and oceanographic survey capabilities to deliver the required capacity.\nThree\nHobart\nClass Air Warfare Destroyers will be in service by the early 2020s. To ensure these vessels can keep pace with regional capabilities, upgrades will be made to the AEGIS combat system, weapons, selfâprotection and intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance systems throughout their service life. The vessels will provide Australian and coalition maritime task with defence against air and missile attack.\n24 MHâ60R Seahawk naval combat helicopters are currently being accepted into service. They will enhance the\nHobart\nClass Air Warfare Destroyersâ and\nANZAC\nClass Frigatesâ antiâship and antiâsubmarine warfare operations. A maritime fleet of up to eight MRHâ90 helicopters will support the amphibious and replenishment ship fleet.\nEnhancements to Defenceâs maritime capabilities will provide Australia with enhanced situational awareness of activities in our maritime domain, earlier detection of emerging threats to our border security and faster responses to deter and defeat any such threat.\nPeople\nAn additional around 800 ADF positions will be allocated to 2025â26 to support the substantially larger maritime force. The workforce will need to continue to grow beyond 2025â26, in particular to operate the larger fleet of submarines.\nInfrastructure\nWharf, and training and support facility upgrades to HMAS Stirling in Perth and Fleet Base East (Garden Island) in Sydney to 2025â26 will support our larger and more potent maritime capability. Infrastructure works at Cocos (Keeling) Islands, Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) Base Edinburgh, South Australia; and RAAF Base Tindal, Northern Territory, will ensure that these airfields can support the fleet of Pâ8A Poseidon aircraft. A range of training areas, testing ranges, and other Defence bases will be upgraded to 2025â26 to support our maritime capabilities, including recruitment facilities such as HMAS Cerberus in Victoria.\nDefence Service \u0026 Personnel Records\nFreedom of Information\nInformation Publication Scheme\nPopular publications\nAnnual reports\nBudget\nDefence White Paper\nFOI Disclosures\nInquiry Reports\nPay \u0026 Conditions Manual\nPublications\nIn focus\nPathway to Change\nFighting Fit - ADF Health Portal\nAnzac Centenary\nAnzac Day\nFirst Principles Review\nReport Abuse and Misconduct\nSeMPRO : Victim focused\nFamily and Domestic Violence\nLike the website?\nWe welcome you to take our 20 second survey and help us improve the site.\n \nFeedback\n \nMinister for Defence\nHome page\nBiography\nMedia releases\nSpeeches\nTranscripts\nDefence Service \u0026 Personnel Records\nFreedom of Information\nInformation Publication Scheme\nPopular publications\nAnnual reports\nBudget\nDefence White Paper\nFOI Disclosures\nInquiry Reports\nPay \u0026 Conditions Manual\nPublications\nIn focus\nPathway to Change\nFighting Fit - ADF Health Portal\nAnzac Centenary\nAnzac Day\nFirst Principles Review\nReport Abuse and Misconduct\nSeMPRO : Victim focused\nFamily and Domestic Violence\nLike the website?\nWe welcome you to take our 20 second survey and help us improve the site.\n \nFeedback\n \nMinister for Defence\nHome page\nBiography\nMedia releases\nSpeeches\nTranscripts\nDefending Australia and its National Interests\nContact us\nCopyright\nDisclaimer\nPrivacy\nAccessibility\nSitemap\nError/bug\nToggle responsive view\nBack to top\n","title":"   \t  Maritime Operations and Anti-Submarine Warfare : At a Glance       : Department of Defence","url":"http://defence.gov.au/Whitepaper/AtAGlance/Maritime-Ops.asp","version":1},"task":{"breadth":0,"created":"2018-09-27T21:43:55.534177015Z","depth":0,"host":"defence.gov.au","id":"bemku6ot87468b6omfbg","last_check":"2018-09-27T21:46:14.820275373Z","last_fetch":"2018-09-27T21:46:14.703867657Z","next_check":"2018-09-27T21:56:14.820275373Z","original_url":"http://defence.gov.au/Whitepaper/AtAGlance/Maritime-Ops.asp","reference_url":"http://defence.gov.au/WhitePaper/","schema":"http","snapshot_created":"2018-09-27T21:46:14.703847935Z","snapshot_hash":"56530c14738aca4d2fb8f707895eb5c0afa970c6","snapshot_id":"bemkv9gt8746bdj87oa0","snapshot_version":1,"status":3,"updated":"2018-09-27T21:46:14.683088144Z","url":"http://defence.gov.au/Whitepaper/AtAGlance/Maritime-Ops.asp"}}}]}}}},{"_index":"gopa-index","_type":"doc","_id":"0a8a3cd56f945ebdafdd7043976c9df9","_score":1.3814803,"_source":{"host":"defence.gov.au","snapshot":{"content_type":"text/html","created":"2018-09-27T21:46:14.819521141Z","description":"\nAt a glance.

This force will be achieved through the\nGovernmentâs funding plan, which raises Defence funding to two per cent of Gross Domestic\nProduction by 2020â21. The Defence budget will rise from $32.4 billion in 2016â17 to $58.7 billion in\n2025â26, with approximately $195 billion to be invested in Defence capability over this period.\nMaritime Operations and AntiâSubmarine Warfare\nThe Government will invest around 25 per cent of Defence capability expenditure to 2025â26 in our\nmaritime operations and antiâsubmarine warfare capabilities as part of a significant regeneration of\nour maritime capabilities. Key capabilities will include: 12 new regionally superior submarines; nine\nnew antiâsubmarine warfare frigates; 12 new offshore patrol vessels; seven additional Pâ8A Poseidon\nmaritime surveillance and response aircraft for a total of 15 aircraft by the late 2020s (which will\ncomplement the seven MQâ4C Triton unmanned surveillance aircraft); new maritime tactical\nunmanned aircraft to improve our shipsâ situational awareness on operations; modernised mine\ncountermeasures and hydrographicârelated capabilities; and a new deployable landâbased antiâship\nmissile capability.\nIntelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance, Space, Electronic Warfare and\nCyber Security\nThe Government will invest around nine per cent of Defence capability expenditure to 2025â26 in\nstrengthening our intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance, electronic warfare, space, and cyber\ncapabilities so that our forces have a comprehensive awareness of what is happening around them\nand the ability to respond. Key capabilities will include: enhanced intelligence collection and analysis,\nincluding in support of targeting; enhancements to broad area surveillance through the acquisition\nof the MQâ4C Triton unmanned surveillance aircraft and enhancements to the Jindalee Operational\nRadar Network; strengthened electronic warfare support to naval, air and land forces, including\nthrough the 12 E/Aâ18G Growler electronic attack aircraft and a new long range electronic warfare\nsupport capability based on the Gulfstream G550 airframe, with additional modified systems;\nenhanced space situational awareness; and enhanced cyber capabilities to deter and defend against\nthe threat of cyber attack.\nKey Enablers\nThe Government will invest around 25 per cent of Defence capability expenditure to 2025â26 in the\nenablers that are essential to the operation and sustainment of the ADF. Even the most capable\nplatforms and systems will not be effective without the enabling capabilities that allow those\nplatforms to operate. Key enabling capabilities to receive substantial investment over the next\ndecade include: our people; critical infrastructure such as bases, training ranges, wharves and\nairfields; information and communications technology; simulators; logistics; science and technology;\nhealth services; and strengthening force design, strategic and international policy.\nAir and Sea Lift\nThe Government will invest around six per cent of Defence capability expenditure to 2025â26 in air\nand sea lift capabilities. The long distances over which the ADF is required to operate means flexible\nand high endurance air and sea lift capabilities are essential to lift, move, and sustain the ADF.\nKey capabilities will include: two additional heavyâlift Câ17A Globemaster III transport aircraft\nalready acquired to complement the existing six Câ17A fleet (with consideration of further additional\nheavy lift aircraft at a later stage); two additional KCâ30A airâtoâair refuellers for a total of seven\naircraft (expanding the fleet to nine aircraft will be considered in the longer term); three additional\nCHâ47F Chinook heavyâlift helicopters to complement previously planned CHâ47F Chinook heavyâlift\nhelicopters for a fleet of 10 aircraft, extension and upgrades for the logistics support ship,\nHMAS Choules; two new replenishment ships by 2026 to resupply naval forces with the option for a\nthird replenishment or additional logistics ship in the late 2020s; and a large hulled multiâpurpose\npatrol vessel for the Navy to support border protection and maritime resource security related tasks.\nStrike and Air Combat\nThe Government will invest around 17 per cent of Defence capability expenditure to 2025â26 in our\nstrike and air combat capabilities. More potent strike capabilities will provide flexibility for the ADF\nto rapidly respond to threats against Australia and provide military contributions to support regional\nsecurity and coalition operations globally where our interests are engaged. Key capabilities will\ninclude: 72 Fâ35A Lightning II Joint Strike Fighters to enter service from 2020 to replace the current\nfleet of 71 F/Aâ18A/B Classic Hornets; 12 EAâ18G Growler electronic attack aircraft to enter service\nfrom 2018; new airâtoâsurface, airâtoâair and highâspeed and longârange strike and antiâship\nweapons; and strengthened command and control, integrated air and missile defence, and\nsituational awareness capabilities to support strike and air combat operations.\nLand Combat and Amphibious Warfare\nThe Government will invest around 18 per cent of Defence capability expenditure to 2025â26 in our\nland combat and amphibious warfare capabilities to provide greater mobility, firepower, protection\nand situational awareness. Key capabilities will include: a new program for continuous upgrade of\npersonal equipment and force protection for our soldiers; new combat reconnaissance, infantry\nfighting, and protected mobility vehicles; upgrades to the M1 Abrams Main Battle Tanks; new armed\nintelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance unmanned aircraft; a new longârange rocket system to\ncomplement existing artillery; logistics enablers to support the amphibious deployment capability of\nthe two Canberra Class ships; and a new fleet of lightly armed boats for operations in a wide range\nof estuarine environments.

The Government will invest around 17 per cent of Defence capital expenditure in our strike and air combat capabilities to 2025â26. More potent strike capabilities will provide flexibility for the Australian Defence Force (ADF) to rapidly respond to threats against Australia and provide military contributions to support regional security and coalition operations globally, where our interests are engaged.\nThe ADF will be equipped with a potent and technologically advanced air combat and strike capability, building on the current fleet of 24 F/Aâ18F Super Hornets, 71 F/Aâ18A/B Classic Hornets, and six Eâ7A Wedgetail airborne early warning and control aircraft.\nKey Strike and Air Combat capabilities\nThe Government will ensure that the ADF has the most capable weapons to fulfil its strike and air combat missions in the future. A series of new airâtoâsurface, airâtoâair and highâspeed and longârange strike and antiâship weapons will be acquired for the strike and air combat capability.\nThe ADFâs integrated air and missile defence system will also be enhanced to improve the accuracy and speed of ADF systemsâ response to air and missile threats, and to integrate and share air and space surveillance information more effectively. The Government will increase investment in capabilities to better connect the communications, sensor and targeting systems of various platforms so that they can more effectively combine their capabilities, generating greater potency and lethality. The ADFâs enhanced integrated air and missile defence capabilities will have the flexibility for further enhancement to handle more complex threats that may emerge in the future.\nDefence will also acquire groundâbased active electronically scanned array radars from around 2020 and expand Australiaâs access to air and space situational awareness information, including through spaceâbased systems.\nThe Government will also introduce a more sophisticated groundâbased air defence system to replace the shortârange RBSâ70 missile system. A new manâportable shortârange system will be introduced by the early 2020s, and will be supplemented by an advanced tactical and mediumârange surfaceâtoâair missile system in the mid to late 2020s, providing layered airâdefence against a broad range of capable air threats.\nThe 72 fifth generation Fâ35A Lightning II Joint Strike Fighters will enter service from 2020 to replace the F/Aâ18A/B Classic Hornets. The Joint Strike Fighters will use a mix of airâtoâair and airâtoâsurface weapons, operate at extended range, maintaining stealth, providing a true multiârole capability. The 24 F/Aâ18F Super Hornets will complement the Joint Strike Fighter aircraft. The Super Hornets will be able to strike potential adversary targets, control the air, and enable ADF or coalition maritime or land operations to proceed unhindered. After 2020, the Government will consider options to replace the Super Hornets in around 2030.\nThe 12 E/Aâ18G Growler electronic attack aircraft will enter service from 2018.

The Government will invest around 17 per cent of Defence capital expenditure in our strike and air combat capabilities to 2025â26. More potent strike capabilities will provide flexibility for the Australian Defence Force (ADF) to rapidly respond to threats against Australia and provide military contributions to support regional security and coalition operations globally, where our interests are engaged.\nThe ADF will be equipped with a potent and technologically advanced air combat and strike capability, building on the current fleet of 24 F/Aâ18F Super Hornets, 71 F/Aâ18A/B Classic Hornets, and six Eâ7A Wedgetail airborne early warning and control aircraft.\nKey Strike and Air Combat capabilities\nThe Government will ensure that the ADF has the most capable weapons to fulfil its strike and air combat missions in the future. A series of new airâtoâsurface, airâtoâair and highâspeed and longârange strike and antiâship weapons will be acquired for the strike and air combat capability.\nThe ADFâs integrated air and missile defence system will also be enhanced to improve the accuracy and speed of ADF systemsâ response to air and missile threats, and to integrate and share air and space surveillance information more effectively. The Government will increase investment in capabilities to better connect the communications, sensor and targeting systems of various platforms so that they can more effectively combine their capabilities, generating greater potency and lethality. The ADFâs enhanced integrated air and missile defence capabilities will have the flexibility for further enhancement to handle more complex threats that may emerge in the future.\nDefence will also acquire groundâbased active electronically scanned array radars from around 2020 and expand Australiaâs access to air and space situational awareness information, including through spaceâbased systems.\nThe Government will also introduce a more sophisticated groundâbased air defence system to replace the shortârange RBSâ70 missile system. A new manâportable shortârange system will be introduced by the early 2020s, and will be supplemented by an advanced tactical and mediumârange surfaceâtoâair missile system in the mid to late 2020s, providing layered airâdefence against a broad range of capable air threats.\nThe 72 fifth generation Fâ35A Lightning II Joint Strike Fighters will enter service from 2020 to replace the F/Aâ18A/B Classic Hornets. The Joint Strike Fighters will use a mix of airâtoâair and airâtoâsurface weapons, operate at extended range, maintaining stealth, providing a true multiârole capability. The 24 F/Aâ18F Super Hornets will complement the Joint Strike Fighter aircraft. The Super Hornets will be able to strike potential adversary targets, control the air, and enable ADF or coalition maritime or land operations to proceed unhindered. After 2020, the Government will consider options to replace the Super Hornets in around 2030.\nThe 12 E/Aâ18G Growler electronic attack aircraft will enter service from 2018. The aircraft will provide a unique capability to disrupt, disable or confuse adversariesâ electronic systems such as radars and communications systems. The six inâservice Eâ7A Wedgetail airborne early warning and control aircraft will continue to be upgraded in order to maintain their capability edge to the mid 2030s.\nPeople\nApproximately, an additional 500 ADF positions will be allocated to 2025â26 to support the introduction of more potent strike and air combat capabilities.\nInfrastructure\nThe Government will make a significant investment in new infrastructure and facilities to 2025â26 to support the ADFâs strike and air combat capabilities.

The Government will invest around six per cent of Defence capability expenditure to 2025â26 in our air and sea lift capabilities. Given the substantial distances over which the Australian Defence Force (ADF) must operate â nationally, regionally and globally â air and sea lift capabilities are essential. A flexible force of air and sea lift capabilities will enable the ADF to reach, resupply and sustain missions in different locations. The ADF also needs to have lift capacity to be highly mobile within any area of operation.\nKey air and sea lift capabilities\nThe ADFâs strategic transport capability will be greatly enhanced through the already delivered acquisition of two additional heavyâlift Câ17A Globemaster transport aircraft, capable of moving large cargo and numbers of personnel great distances, such as from Australia to the Middle East, increasing our fleet to eight aircraft. Additional heavy lift aircraft will be considered at a later stage.\nThe Government will extend the range of combat and surveillance aircraft, acquiring two additional KCâ30A airâtoâair refuellers before the end of this decade for a total of seven aircraft. Expanding the fleet to nine aircraft in the longer term will be considered to meet increasing demand.\nOur Chinook helicopters are a workhorse of the ADF, capable of moving stores and personnel, including vehicles and artillery around the battlefield or from ships to the land without the need for an airfield as well as undertaking aeroâmedical evacuation. The Government will acquire three additional CHâ47F Chinook heavyâlift helicopters in the near term to expand battlefield lift capacity and support tactical missions including aeroâmedical evacuation for a total of 10 helicopters.\nThe logistics support ship, HMAS Choules, and the two Canberra Class amphibious ships, will provide scalable and flexible options for greater capacity sea lift and amphibious operations. The Government will extend the life of HMAS Choules and update the capabilities onboard, including modern self defence and aviation support systems until it is replaced around 2030.\nIn addition, the Government will acquire a new large hulled multiâpurpose patrol vessel, the Australian Defence Vessel Ocean Protector for the Navy to support border protection and maritime resource security related tasks with the Australian Border Force.\nSustainment of our maritime capabilities will be improved by two new replenishment vessels that will begin service by 2026. The vessels will provide naval combat units with fuel, water and stores while underway at sea. A third replenishment vessel or additional logistics support ship will be acquired the late 2020s.\nTogether, HMAS\nChoules\n, the amphibious ships, and replenishment vessels, will enable the ADF to conduct a greater number of challenging maritime operations at the same time, and to sustain those operations for longer periods than we can today.\nThe Government will acquire enhanced aeroâmedical evacuation and search and rescue capabilities for our forces, with upgrades to aeroâmedical equipment for the Chinook helicopters commencing from 2016. In the longer term, options will be investigated for a dedicated longârange combat search and rescue capability.\nThe Government will upgrade the 12 Câ130J Hercules medium transport aircraft to ensure that they can continue to fulfil their critical role in moving stores and equipment within our region when required.\n10 Câ27J Spartan medium transport aircraft are currently being introduced into service. The Spartans will enhance the ADFâs air lift capability, providing a unique capacity to move personnel and small cargos to remote locations using shorter landing strips not suitable for any other fixed wing military aircraft in the ADF fleet.\nThe MRHâ90 Troop lift helicopter will continue to be introduced into service, with Army to operate 39 to 41 aircraft and Navy to operate up to eight aircraft. The aircraft will be a force multiplier for Army in tactical air mobility and for Navy in maritime support. Current plans include a requirement for roleâspecific upgrades to the MRHâ90 Troop lift helicopter to replace the Sâ70A Blackhawk in support of domestic counter terrorism operations.\nPeople\nAn additional around 800 ADF positions will be allocated to 2025â26 to assist with the air and sea lift fleets, including introduction of the two additional heavy lift Câ17A Globemaster transport aircraft, two additional airâtoâair refuelling aircraft, 10 Câ27J Spartan medium transport aircraft, two new replenishment vessels, and three additional CHâ47 Chinook heavyâlift helicopters.\nInfrastructure\nSubstantial investment in support of air lift is programmed for upgraded infrastructure at RAAF Base Amberley, Queensland, including facilities to support an increased number of tactical, medium and strategic lift aircraft.

The Government will invest around six per cent of Defence capability expenditure to 2025â26 in our air and sea lift capabilities. Given the substantial distances over which the Australian Defence Force (ADF) must operate â nationally, regionally and globally â air and sea lift capabilities are essential. A flexible force of air and sea lift capabilities will enable the ADF to reach, resupply and sustain missions in different locations. The ADF also needs to have lift capacity to be highly mobile within any area of operation.\nKey air and sea lift capabilities\nThe ADFâs strategic transport capability will be greatly enhanced through the already delivered acquisition of two additional heavyâlift Câ17A Globemaster transport aircraft, capable of moving large cargo and numbers of personnel great distances, such as from Australia to the Middle East, increasing our fleet to eight aircraft. Additional heavy lift aircraft will be considered at a later stage.\nThe Government will extend the range of combat and surveillance aircraft, acquiring two additional KCâ30A airâtoâair refuellers before the end of this decade for a total of seven aircraft. Expanding the fleet to nine aircraft in the longer term will be considered to meet increasing demand.\nOur Chinook helicopters are a workhorse of the ADF, capable of moving stores and personnel, including vehicles and artillery around the battlefield or from ships to the land without the need for an airfield as well as undertaking aeroâmedical evacuation. The Government will acquire three additional CHâ47F Chinook heavyâlift helicopters in the near term to expand battlefield lift capacity and support tactical missions including aeroâmedical evacuation for a total of 10 helicopters.\nThe logistics support ship, HMAS Choules, and the two Canberra Class amphibious ships, will provide scalable and flexible options for greater capacity sea lift and amphibious operations. The Government will extend the life of HMAS Choules and update the capabilities onboard, including modern self defence and aviation support systems until it is replaced around 2030.\nIn addition, the Government will acquire a new large hulled multiâpurpose patrol vessel, the Australian Defence Vessel Ocean Protector for the Navy to support border protection and maritime resource security related tasks with the Australian Border Force.\nSustainment of our maritime capabilities will be improved by two new replenishment vessels that will begin service by 2026. The vessels will provide naval combat units with fuel, water and stores while underway at sea. A third replenishment vessel or additional logistics support ship will be acquired the late 2020s.\nTogether, HMAS\nChoules\n, the amphibious ships, and replenishment vessels, will enable the ADF to conduct a greater number of challenging maritime operations at the same time, and to sustain those operations for longer periods than we can today.\nThe Government will acquire enhanced aeroâmedical evacuation and search and rescue capabilities for our forces, with upgrades to aeroâmedical equipment for the Chinook helicopters commencing from 2016. In the longer term, options will be investigated for a dedicated longârange combat search and rescue capability.\nThe Government will upgrade the 12 Câ130J Hercules medium transport aircraft to ensure that they can continue to fulfil their critical role in moving stores and equipment within our region when required.\n10 Câ27J Spartan medium transport aircraft are currently being introduced into service. The Spartans will enhance the ADFâs air lift capability, providing a unique capacity to move personnel and small cargos to remote locations using shorter landing strips not suitable for any other fixed wing military aircraft in the ADF fleet.\nThe MRHâ90 Troop lift helicopter will continue to be introduced into service, with Army to operate 39 to 41 aircraft and Navy to operate up to eight aircraft. The aircraft will be a force multiplier for Army in tactical air mobility and for Navy in maritime support. Current plans include a requirement for roleâspecific upgrades to the MRHâ90 Troop lift helicopter to replace the Sâ70A Blackhawk in support of domestic counter terrorism operations.\nPeople\nAn additional around 800 ADF positions will be allocated to 2025â26 to assist with the air and sea lift fleets, including introduction of the two additional heavy lift Câ17A Globemaster transport aircraft, two additional airâtoâair refuelling aircraft, 10 Câ27J Spartan medium transport aircraft, two new replenishment vessels, and three additional CHâ47 Chinook heavyâlift helicopters.\nInfrastructure\nSubstantial investment in support of air lift is programmed for upgraded infrastructure at RAAF Base Amberley, Queensland, including facilities to support an increased number of tactical, medium and strategic lift aircraft. Funding is also programmed at RAAF Base Richmond, New South Wales, in the latter years of the decade to 2025â26.\nAustraliaâs growing sea lift capability will be supported by planned upgrades to wharves and port facilities, including substantial investment in Fleet Base East, combined with continued commercial arrangements for ADF access to civilian infrastructure.\nDefence Service \u0026 Personnel Records\nFreedom of Information\nInformation Publication Scheme\nPopular publications\nAnnual reports\nBudget\nDefence White Paper\nFOI Disclosures\nInquiry Reports\nPay \u0026 Conditions Manual\nPublications\nIn focus\nPathway to Change\nFighting Fit - ADF Health Portal\nAnzac Centenary\nAnzac Day\nFirst Principles Review\nReport Abuse and Misconduct\nSeMPRO : Victim focused\nFamily and Domestic Violence\nLike the website?\nWe welcome you to take our 20 second survey and help us improve the site.\n \nFeedback\n \nMinister for Defence\nHome page\nBiography\nMedia releases\nSpeeches\nTranscripts\nDefence Service \u0026 Personnel Records\nFreedom of Information\nInformation Publication Scheme\nPopular publications\nAnnual reports\nBudget\nDefence White Paper\nFOI Disclosures\nInquiry Reports\nPay \u0026 Conditions Manual\nPublications\nIn focus\nPathway to Change\nFighting Fit - ADF Health Portal\nAnzac Centenary\nAnzac Day\nFirst Principles Review\nReport Abuse and Misconduct\nSeMPRO : Victim focused\nFamily and Domestic Violence\nLike the website?\nWe welcome you to take our 20 second survey and help us improve the site.\n \nFeedback\n \nMinister for Defence\nHome page\nBiography\nMedia releases\nSpeeches\nTranscripts\nDefending Australia and its National Interests\nContact us\nCopyright\nDisclaimer\nPrivacy\nAccessibility\nSitemap\nError/bug\nToggle responsive view\nBack to top\n","title":"   \t  Air and Sea Lift Capability : At a Glance       : Department of Defence","url":"http://defence.gov.au/Whitepaper/AtAGlance/Air-Sea-Lift.asp","version":1},"task":{"breadth":0,"created":"2018-09-27T21:43:55.533838966Z","depth":0,"host":"defence.gov.au","id":"bemku6ot87468b6omfag","last_check":"2018-09-27T21:46:14.820064928Z","last_fetch":"2018-09-27T21:46:14.642788256Z","next_check":"2018-09-27T21:56:14.820064928Z","original_url":"http://defence.gov.au/Whitepaper/AtAGlance/Air-Sea-Lift.asp","reference_url":"http://defence.gov.au/WhitePaper/","schema":"http","snapshot_created":"2018-09-27T21:46:14.642766527Z","snapshot_hash":"e51262c05664c75bd843b243e177eb7dc9fcc504","snapshot_id":"bemkv9gt8746bdj87o80","snapshot_version":1,"status":3,"updated":"2018-09-27T21:46:14.465695344Z","url":"http://defence.gov.au/Whitepaper/AtAGlance/Air-Sea-Lift.asp"}}}]}}}},{"_index":"gopa-index","_type":"doc","_id":"e2edd4c2a6d14fd3a1088a57da104e74","_score":1.4586792,"_source":{"host":"defence.gov.au","snapshot":{"content_type":"text/html","created":"2018-09-27T21:46:14.757960453Z","description":"\nAt a glance.

The Defence Industry Policy Statement provides the foundation to take the partnerships between Defence and industry to new levels of cooperation, with a focus on stronger, more strategic\npartnerships and closer alignment between industry investment and Defence capability needs. Initiatives in the Defence Industry Policy Statement will see the development of a technologically advanced, innovationâdriven and sustainable Australian defence industrial base, which is well placed to assist Defence in protecting Australiaâs national interests.\nDelivering Defence Capability\nThe Governmentâs 10âyear Defence budget plan to 2025â26 grows the Defence budget from $32.4 billion in 2016â17 to $58.7 billion in 2025â26, providing an additional $29.9 billion to Defence over this period than previously planned. The Government will invest approximately $195 billion in Defence capability to 2025â26, restoring confidence in Defenceâs long term funding.\nFor the first time, the 2016 Integrated Investment Program released with the Defence White Paper brings together all elements of Defence investment, including equipment, facilities, workforce, and information and communications technology as well as major weapons, platforms and systems. Australian industry now has the clarity and certainty to invest in the people and infrastructure to make these capability plans a reality.\nThe 2016 Defence Industry Policy Statement, the First Principles Review and the Governmentâs decisions on naval shipbuilding, reinforce the importance of treating Australian industry as a fundamental input to capability. It will be mandatory for Defence to consider Australian industry in the formal capability development process. This will help industry to better match specialist skills and advances in science and technology to develop innovative solutions for new capabilities.\nStrategic Partnership with Industry\nThe Government places a high priority on maximising the innovation potential of the Australian economy. Innovation will be reâpositioned as an essential driver to generate new capabilities for Defence and new opportunities for Australian industry. The Governmentâs Defence Industry Policy Statement complements the 2015 National Innovation and Science Agenda, with a focus on maximising the delivery of Defence capability through a more focused, coordinated and transparent effort between Defence and industry. The Statement will transform Defenceâs approach to innovation, and create a seamless link between capability needs, smart ideas and innovation in Australian industry. New initiatives will harness Australiaâs potential for innovation by streamlining engagement with industry, academic and research organisations, and by establishing a single endâtoend\ninnovation pipeline with a clear path to commercialisation.\nHarnessing Australian Innovation in the Defence Sector\nThe Government is committed to maximising opportunities for competitive Australian businesses; building export potential, depth of skills and diversification for defence industry, and cutting red tape to make it simpler and less costly for Australian industry to support Defence.\nThe initiatives in this Statement will bring Defence and industry closer together and drive the changes we need to ensure industry becomes more competitive and highly skilled, and to encourage investment both at the local and international level.\nThe new Defence Industry Policy Statement centres on two key initiatives: the Centre for Defence Industry Capability and a new approach to Defence innovation. These initiatives will deliver around $1.6 billion in investment in Defenceârelated innovation to 2025â26, supporting Australian science and technology and innovation to provide advanced homeâgrown Defence capabilities.\nThe Centre for Defence Industry Capability will be funded at around $230 million to 2025â26. The Centre will promote defence industry competitiveness, guide the priorities across defence industry, and connect Defence capability with innovation.\nAround $730 million to 2025â26 will be provided for research on next generation technologies with the potential to deliver gameâchanging capabilities critical to defence and national security.\nThe Defence Innovation Hub (the Hub) will be a virtual network, funded at around $640 million to 2025â26 to bring together Defenceâs innovation programs. The Hub will enable defence industry to collaborate on innovation efforts that deliver a capability edge throughout the capability life cycle from initial concept, through prototyping and testing to introduction into service.\nThe Defence Innovation Portal, as part of the Centre for Defence Industry Capability, will be a key communication bridge between Defence, industry and academia, providing vital connections between small to medium enterprises and Defence.\nA Strong and Sustainable Australian Naval Shipbuilding Industry\nA strong, viable and sustainable Australian naval shipbuilding industry is a vital element of Australiaâs defence capability to manage Australiaâs strategic challenges to 2035. The Government is delivering a longâterm plan to ensure retention of a sovereign Australian naval shipbuilding industry and the jobs that go with it. The Governmentâs strategy is centred on a longâterm continuous build of major warships and minor naval vessels in Australia.\nIn the short term, the continuous build strategy will sustain around 1,000 jobs that would otherwise have been lost, and will guarantee around 2,500 longâterm Australian surface shipbuilding jobs for decades to come. This strategy will transform Australiaâs shipbuilding industry and put an end to the boomâbust cycle that has afflicted the industry, and has led to the current shipbuilding âvalley of deathâ. The Government is confident in the ability of Australian defence industry to play its part in moving to a continuous build program for naval surface ships, which will require unprecedented reform of the Australian naval shipbuilding industry focused on significant improvements in productivity.\nDefence Service \u0026 Personnel Records\nFreedom of Information\nInformation Publication Scheme\nPopular publications\nAnnual reports\nBudget\nDefence White Paper\nFOI Disclosures\nInquiry Reports\nPay \u0026 Conditions Manual\nPublications\nIn focus\nPathway to Change\nFighting Fit - ADF Health Portal\nAnzac Centenary\nAnzac Day\nFirst Principles Review\nReport Abuse and Misconduct\nSeMPRO : Victim focused\nFamily and Domestic Violence\nLike the website?\nWe welcome you to take our 20 second survey and help us improve the site.\n \nFeedback\n \nMinister for Defence\nHome page\nBiography\nMedia releases\nSpeeches\nTranscripts\nDefence Service \u0026 Personnel Records\nFreedom of Information\nInformation Publication Scheme\nPopular publications\nAnnual reports\nBudget\nDefence White Paper\nFOI Disclosures\nInquiry Reports\nPay \u0026 Conditions Manual\nPublications\nIn focus\nPathway to Change\nFighting Fit - ADF Health Portal\nAnzac Centenary\nAnzac Day\nFirst Principles Review\nReport Abuse and Misconduct\nSeMPRO : Victim focused\nFamily and Domestic Violence\nLike the website?\nWe welcome you to take our 20 second survey and help us improve the site.\n \nFeedback\n \nMinister for Defence\nHome page\nBiography\nMedia releases\nSpeeches\nTranscripts\nDefending Australia and its National Interests\nContact us\nCopyright\nDisclaimer\nPrivacy\nAccessibility\nSitemap\nError/bug\nToggle responsive view\nBack to top\n","title":"   \t  Defence Industry : At a Glance       : Department of Defence","url":"http://defence.gov.au/Whitepaper/AtAGlance/Defence-Industry.asp","version":1},"task":{"breadth":0,"created":"2018-09-27T21:43:55.534336782Z","depth":0,"host":"defence.gov.au","id":"bemku6ot87468b6omfc0","last_check":"2018-09-27T21:46:15.027530355Z","last_fetch":"2018-09-27T21:46:14.757990215Z","next_check":"2018-09-27T21:56:15.027530355Z","original_url":"http://defence.gov.au/Whitepaper/AtAGlance/Defence-Industry.asp","reference_url":"http://defence.gov.au/WhitePaper/","schema":"http","snapshot_created":"2018-09-27T21:46:14.757960453Z","snapshot_hash":"79ffecfdb17899acfdb55d81696e06a8384a7d85","snapshot_id":"bemkv9gt8746bdj87oag","snapshot_version":1,"status":3,"updated":"2018-09-27T21:46:14.703613283Z","url":"http://defence.gov.au/Whitepaper/AtAGlance/Defence-Industry.asp"}},"fields":{"snapshot.title.keyword":["   \t  Defence Industry : At a Glance       : Department of Defence"]},"inner_hits":{"collpased_docs":{"hits":{"total":1,"max_score":1.4586792,"hits":[{"_index":"gopa-index","_type":"doc","_id":"e2edd4c2a6d14fd3a1088a57da104e74","_score":1.4586792,"_source":{"host":"defence.gov.au","snapshot":{"content_type":"text/html","created":"2018-09-27T21:46:14.757960453Z","description":"\nAt a glance.

The Defence Industry Policy Statement provides the foundation to take the partnerships between Defence and industry to new levels of cooperation, with a focus on stronger, more strategic\npartnerships and closer alignment between industry investment and Defence capability needs. Initiatives in the Defence Industry Policy Statement will see the development of a technologically advanced, innovationâdriven and sustainable Australian defence industrial base, which is well placed to assist Defence in protecting Australiaâs national interests.\nDelivering Defence Capability\nThe Governmentâs 10âyear Defence budget plan to 2025â26 grows the Defence budget from $32.4 billion in 2016â17 to $58.7 billion in 2025â26, providing an additional $29.9 billion to Defence over this period than previously planned. The Government will invest approximately $195 billion in Defence capability to 2025â26, restoring confidence in Defenceâs long term funding.\nFor the first time, the 2016 Integrated Investment Program released with the Defence White Paper brings together all elements of Defence investment, including equipment, facilities, workforce, and information and communications technology as well as major weapons, platforms and systems. Australian industry now has the clarity and certainty to invest in the people and infrastructure to make these capability plans a reality.\nThe 2016 Defence Industry Policy Statement, the First Principles Review and the Governmentâs decisions on naval shipbuilding, reinforce the importance of treating Australian industry as a fundamental input to capability. It will be mandatory for Defence to consider Australian industry in the formal capability development process. This will help industry to better match specialist skills and advances in science and technology to develop innovative solutions for new capabilities.\nStrategic Partnership with Industry\nThe Government places a high priority on maximising the innovation potential of the Australian economy. Innovation will be reâpositioned as an essential driver to generate new capabilities for Defence and new opportunities for Australian industry. The Governmentâs Defence Industry Policy Statement complements the 2015 National Innovation and Science Agenda, with a focus on maximising the delivery of Defence capability through a more focused, coordinated and transparent effort between Defence and industry. The Statement will transform Defenceâs approach to innovation, and create a seamless link between capability needs, smart ideas and innovation in Australian industry. New initiatives will harness Australiaâs potential for innovation by streamlining engagement with industry, academic and research organisations, and by establishing a single endâtoend\ninnovation pipeline with a clear path to commercialisation.\nHarnessing Australian Innovation in the Defence Sector\nThe Government is committed to maximising opportunities for competitive Australian businesses; building export potential, depth of skills and diversification for defence industry, and cutting red tape to make it simpler and less costly for Australian industry to support Defence.\nThe initiatives in this Statement will bring Defence and industry closer together and drive the changes we need to ensure industry becomes more competitive and highly skilled, and to encourage investment both at the local and international level.\nThe new Defence Industry Policy Statement centres on two key initiatives: the Centre for Defence Industry Capability and a new approach to Defence innovation. These initiatives will deliver around $1.6 billion in investment in Defenceârelated innovation to 2025â26, supporting Australian science and technology and innovation to provide advanced homeâgrown Defence capabilities.\nThe Centre for Defence Industry Capability will be funded at around $230 million to 2025â26. The Centre will promote defence industry competitiveness, guide the priorities across defence industry, and connect Defence capability with innovation.\nAround $730 million to 2025â26 will be provided for research on next generation technologies with the potential to deliver gameâchanging capabilities critical to defence and national security.\nThe Defence Innovation Hub (the Hub) will be a virtual network, funded at around $640 million to 2025â26 to bring together Defenceâs innovation programs. The Hub will enable defence industry to collaborate on innovation efforts that deliver a capability edge throughout the capability life cycle from initial concept, through prototyping and testing to introduction into service.\nThe Defence Innovation Portal, as part of the Centre for Defence Industry Capability, will be a key communication bridge between Defence, industry and academia, providing vital connections between small to medium enterprises and Defence.\nA Strong and Sustainable Australian Naval Shipbuilding Industry\nA strong, viable and sustainable Australian naval shipbuilding industry is a vital element of Australiaâs defence capability to manage Australiaâs strategic challenges to 2035. The Government is delivering a longâterm plan to ensure retention of a sovereign Australian naval shipbuilding industry and the jobs that go with it. The Governmentâs strategy is centred on a longâterm continuous build of major warships and minor naval vessels in Australia.\nIn the short term, the continuous build strategy will sustain around 1,000 jobs that would otherwise have been lost, and will guarantee around 2,500 longâterm Australian surface shipbuilding jobs for decades to come. This strategy will transform Australiaâs shipbuilding industry and put an end to the boomâbust cycle that has afflicted the industry, and has led to the current shipbuilding âvalley of deathâ. The Government is confident in the ability of Australian defence industry to play its part in moving to a continuous build program for naval surface ships, which will require unprecedented reform of the Australian naval shipbuilding industry focused on significant improvements in productivity.\nDefence Service \u0026 Personnel Records\nFreedom of Information\nInformation Publication Scheme\nPopular publications\nAnnual reports\nBudget\nDefence White Paper\nFOI Disclosures\nInquiry Reports\nPay \u0026 Conditions Manual\nPublications\nIn focus\nPathway to Change\nFighting Fit -

The Government will invest around 18 percent of Defence capital expenditure to 2025â26 in our land combat and amphibious warfare capabilities through greater situational awareness, firepower, protection, mobility and force sustainability. These enhancements will increase Australiaâs capacity for both combat and noncombat operations, including for security and stabilisation operations and the provision of humanitarian assistance and disaster relief.\nKey land combat and amphibious warfare capabilities\nAustralian soldiers will continue to receive the worldâclass equipment, weapons systems and protection they need to undertake their important roles. Key weapons systems to be acquired include: new rifles and pistols; direct fire support weapons, including those used against armoured vehicles, bunkers and installations; and indirect weapons such as mortars. New improved personal protection equipment will be acquired, such as body armour, nightâfighting equipment, and protective equipment to mitigate chemical, biological and radiological threats. Defence will continuously monitor, adapt and improve the personal equipment and weapons systems to respond quickly to evolving operational requirements.\nNew combat reconnaissance, infantry fighting, new generation armoured and protected mobility fleets and upgrades to the M1 Abrams Main Battle Tanks will ensure our forces have the protection, mobility and firepower they need to defeat potential adversaries on the future battlefield. On 5 October, 2015, the Government announced acquisition of 1,100 locally built Hawkei protected vehicles and over 1,000 trailers.\nOur land forces will have unprecedented knowledge of what is happening around them and the firepower to respond. A new armed intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR) unmanned aircraft capability is programmed for the early 2020s, to facilitate the timely delivery of accurate information to commanders at all levels, and provide superior situational awareness to inform decisionâmaking. This capability will enhance the Australian Defence Forceâs counterâterrorism support capability overseas and could augment search and rescue, humanitarian assistance and disaster relief and coastal surveillance. New small unmanned aircraft will provide better realâtime ISR support to tactical commanders.\nA new long range rocket system will be acquired in the midâ2020s to provide additional firepower at greater distances (up to around 300km) to complement our existing artillery capability. Our 22 Tiger Armed Reconnaissance helicopters, which provide firepower for our land force operations, will be replaced from the mid 2020s by manned or unmanned systems, or a combination of both, depending on technological developments.\nNew protected and unprotected engineering platforms including cranes, excavators, front end loaders, forklifts, and tractors; armoured bridging and breaching platforms; aviation and fire trucks; and other support capabilities will be acquired over the next decade to support our forces.\nBattlefield logistic support to our troops will be enhanced, including deployable logistics information systems, and replacement of maritime transport vessels. A riverine patrol capability will be reâestablished through a fleet of lightly armed boats from around 2022 to allow operations in estuarine environments. New deployable land communication networks, including satellite and terrestrial communications, will equip our forces with the communications capabilities they need for future operations.\nAmphibious capability\nAustraliaâs strengthened amphibious capability centres around our new\nCanberra\nClass amphibious ships, which will provide the ADF with an unprecedented capability to conduct a wide range of operations in the maritime environment. These amphibious ships will enable the ADF to land a sizeable force of personnel and equipment across a broad spectrum of operations. The\nCanberra\nClass shipsâ onâboard hospital and their ability to operate without wharves or port infrastructure will be a major asset in support of both domestic and international disaster recovery missions. Over time, the capability of the ships will be enhanced to better support joint command and control, including upgrades to communications and intelligence systems and semiâautonomous self defence capabilities. In the longer term, we will replace the shipsâ landing craft used to transport people and equipment from ship to shore. Together with our logistics support ship, HMAS\nChoules\n, the amphibious ships will provide scalable and flexible options for amphibious operations and sea lift.\nSpecial Forces\nAustraliaâs Special Forces undertake complex tactical operations across a range of combat environments. This includes a range of specialist response options when deployed overseas, such as supporting air strikes, reconnaissance and rescue missions. Special Forces are also responsible for domestic counterâterrorism roles when required. Our capability will be significantly enhanced with new highâend weapons, improved mission command networks and situational awareness tools, enhanced tactical mobility, specialised force protection, and logistic support capabilities. The Government will also deliver a new fleet of light helicopters (which are rapidly deployable by transport aircraft) from the midâ2020s to enhance mobility for special operations missions.\nPeople\nAround 700 additional ADF positions will be allocated to 2025â26 to support our strengthened land combat and amphibious warfare capabilities.\nInfrastructure\nWe will upgrade bases including in Brisbane, Darwin, Sydney, Puckapunyal in Victoria, and Townsville, and weapon ranges and training areas such as Puckapunyal and Shoalwater Bay, Queensland to 2025â26. Upgrades to HMAS Stirling in Perth and Fleet Base East (Garden Island) in Sydney will support the amphibious ships. New facilities will support new unmanned aircraft, including at Royal Australian Air Force bases Townsville and Tindal, Northern Territory; Shoalwater Bay; and at the Cultana and Woomera ranges in South Australia.\nDefence Service \u0026 Personnel Records\nFreedom of Information\nInformation Publication Scheme\nPopular publications\nAnnual reports\nBudget\nDefence White Paper\nFOI Disclosures\nInquiry Reports\nPay \u0026 Conditions Manual\nPublications\nIn focus\nPathway to Change\nFighting Fit - ADF Health Portal\nAnzac Centenary\nAnzac Day\nFirst Principles Review\nReport Abuse and Misconduct\nSeMPRO : Victim focused\nFamily and Domestic Violence\nLike the website?\nWe welcome you to take our 20 second survey and help us improve the site.\n \nFeedback\n \nMinister for Defence\nHome page\nBiography\nMedia releases\nSpeeches\nTranscripts\nDefence Service \u0026 Personnel Records\nFreedom of Information\nInformation Publication Scheme\nPopular publications\nAnnual reports\nBudget\nDefence White Paper\nFOI Disclosures\nInquiry Reports\nPay \u0026 Conditions Manual\nPublications\nIn focus\nPathway to Change\nFighting Fit - ADF Health Portal\nAnzac Centenary\nAnzac Day\nFirst Principles Review\nReport Abuse and Misconduct\nSeMPRO : Victim focused\nFamily and Domestic Violence\nLike the website?\nWe welcome you to take our 20 second survey and help us improve the site.\n \nFeedback\n \nMinister for Defence\nHome page\nBiography\nMedia releases\nSpeeches\nTranscripts\nDefending Australia and its National Interests\nContact us\nCopyright\nDisclaimer\nPrivacy\nAccessibility\nSitemap\nError/bug\nToggle responsive view\nBack to top\n","title":"   \t  Land Combat and Amphibious Warfare : At a Glance       : Department of Defence","url":"http://defence.gov.au/Whitepaper/AtAGlance/Land-Combat-Amphib.asp","version":1},"task":{"breadth":0,"created":"2018-09-27T21:43:56.019505784Z","depth":0,"host":"defence.gov.au","id":"bemku70t87468b6omfug","last_check":"2018-09-27T21:46:16.340332338Z","last_fetch":"2018-09-27T21:46:15.992110815Z","next_check":"2018-09-27T21:56:16.340332338Z","original_url":"http://defence.gov.au/Whitepaper/AtAGlance/Land-Combat-Amphib.asp","reference_url":"http://defence.gov.au/WhitePaper/","schema":"http","snapshot_created":"2018-09-27T21:46:15.992087233Z","snapshot_hash":"5a6fcbcdfc8e99f5dfe274fb65b632614c01b22e","snapshot_id":"bemkv9ot8746bdj87u5g","snapshot_version":1,"status":3,"updated":"2018-09-27T21:46:15.982759857Z","url":"http://defence.gov.au/Whitepaper/AtAGlance/Land-Combat-Amphib.asp"}},"fields":{"snapshot.title.keyword":["   \t  Land Combat and Amphibious Warfare : At a Glance       : Department of Defence"]},"inner_hits":{"collpased_docs":{"hits":{"total":1,"max_score":1.3814803,"hits":[{"_index":"gopa-index","_type":"doc","_id":"bd8dd3363ee9467e934451bb904a5425","_score":1.3814803,"_source":{"host":"defence.gov.au","snapshot":{"content_type":"text/html","created":"2018-09-27T21:46:15.992087233Z","description":"\nAt a glance.

The Government will invest around 18 percent of Defence capital expenditure to 2025â26 in our land combat and amphibious warfare capabilities through greater situational awareness, firepower, protection, mobility and force sustainability. These enhancements will increase Australiaâs capacity for both combat and noncombat operations, including for security and stabilisation operations and the provision of humanitarian assistance and disaster relief.\nKey land combat and amphibious warfare capabilities\nAustralian soldiers will continue to receive the worldâclass equipment, weapons systems and protection they need to undertake their important roles. Key weapons systems to be acquired include: new rifles and pistols; direct fire support weapons, including those used against armoured vehicles, bunkers and installations; and indirect weapons such as mortars. New improved personal protection equipment will be acquired, such as body armour, nightâfighting equipment, and protective equipment to mitigate chemical, biological and radiological threats. Defence will continuously monitor, adapt and improve the personal equipment and weapons systems to respond quickly to evolving operational requirements.\nNew combat reconnaissance, infantry fighting, new generation armoured and protected mobility fleets and upgrades to the M1 Abrams Main Battle Tanks will ensure our forces have the protection, mobility and firepower they need to defeat potential adversaries on the future battlefield.

The Government will invest around 25 percent of Defence capital expenditure to 2025â26 in our maritime capabilities in the most comprehensive regeneration of our Navy since the Second World War. Our maritime forces will become more potent out to the 2030s through more capable submarines, ships and aircraft and better integration of combat and supporting systems across Defence. This will enable our forces to protect our maritime borders and resources, secure our immediate northern approaches and proximate sea lines of communication, and project force in the maritime environment.\nKey maritime operations and antiâsubmarine warfare capabilities\nThe future submarine program is the largest defence procurement in Australiaâs history. A fleet of 12 new regionally superior submarines with a high degree of interoperability with the United States will replace the six current\nCollins\nClass submarines. The new submarines will provide an essential element of Australiaâs deterrent capability. The key roles of the future submarine will include: antiâsubmarine warfare; antiâsurface vessel warfare; intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance; and support to special operations. The results of the competitive evaluation process will be announced this year. The\nCollins\nClass submarine fleet will continue to be supported and upgraded to ensure that it remains a potent capability through the rest of its life and until transition to the new submarine.\nThe new submarines will likely begin to enter service in the early 2030s, with delivery extending over two decades to around 2050. A rolling acquisition program for Australiaâs future submarines will ensure that Australia is able to maintain a fleet of 12 regionally superior submarines as submarine and antiâsubmarine technologies develop over time. As part of a rolling acquisition program, a review of strategic circumstances and developments in submarine technology will be conducted in the late 2020s to consider whether the configuration of the submarines remains suitable or whether consideration of other specifications should commence. A rolling program of acquiring submarines will provide longâterm planning certainty for Australian industry, allowing companies to invest in the capabilities needed to support their involvement in the construction and sustainment activities.\nNine new antiâsubmarine warfare frigates will be introduced into service from the late 2020s, with construction to start in 2020, to replace the existing fleet of eight ANZAC Class frigates. The new frigates will have the range and endurance to operate throughout maritime South East Asia and be deployable from forward bases, such as in the Middle East. They will be equipped with offensive and selfâprotection systems.\nTwelve new offshore patrol vessels (OPV) will begin entering service from the early 2020s, with construction to start in 2018, replacing the 13\nArmidale\nClass patrol boats. The OPVs will have greater reach, endurance and capacity than the\nArmidale\nClass patrol boat fleet, allowing them to perform a broader range of border protection and patrol missions.\nAustraliaâs maritime surveillance and response capability will be significantly enhanced through the Governmentâs acquisition of seven additional Pâ8A Poseidon maritime surveillance and response aircraft to be acquired in two tranches for a total of 15 by the late 2020s. In addition to their sophisticated surveillance capabilities, these aircraft can undertake offensive operations against submarines and ships, as well as supporting search and rescue operations.\nTo improve our shipsâ situational awareness on operations, a new maritime tactical unmanned aircraft will also be delivered over the next decade. The tactical unmanned aircraft will be deployable on a range of Royal Australian Navy vessels including the OPVs and antiâsubmarine warfare frigates.\nAustraliaâs military hydrography capability provides sailors with precision measurement of the physical features of the oceans and water mass. The current fleet of two large and four smaller ADF hydrographic survey vessels will be progressively retired from around the early 2020s. Defence will replace this capability with an efficient combination of military and commercial hydrographic and oceanographic survey capabilities to deliver the required capacity.\nThree\nHobart\nClass Air Warfare Destroyers will be in service by the early 2020s. To ensure these vessels can keep pace with regional capabilities, upgrades will be made to the AEGIS combat system, weapons, selfâprotection and intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance systems throughout their service life. The vessels will provide Australian and coalition maritime task with defence against air and missile attack.\n24 MHâ60R Seahawk naval combat helicopters are currently being accepted into service. They will enhance the\nHobart\nClass Air Warfare Destroyersâ and\nANZAC\nClass Frigatesâ antiâship and antiâsubmarine warfare operations. A maritime fleet of up to eight MRHâ90 helicopters will support the amphibious and replenishment ship fleet.\nEnhancements to Defenceâs maritime capabilities will provide Australia with enhanced situational awareness of activities in our maritime domain, earlier detection of emerging threats to our border security and faster responses to deter and defeat any such threat.\nPeople\nAn additional around 800 ADF positions will be allocated to 2025â26 to support the substantially larger maritime force. The workforce will need to continue to grow beyond 2025â26, in particular to operate the larger fleet of submarines.\nInfrastructure\nWharf, and training and support facility upgrades to HMAS Stirling in Perth and Fleet Base East (Garden Island) in Sydney to 2025â26 will support our larger and more potent maritime capability. Infrastructure works at Cocos (Keeling) Islands, Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) Base Edinburgh, South Australia; and RAAF Base Tindal, Northern Territory, will ensure that these airfields can support the fleet of Pâ8A Poseidon aircraft. A range of training areas, testing ranges, and other Defence bases will be upgraded to 2025â26 to support our maritime capabilities, including recruitment facilities such as HMAS Cerberus in Victoria.\nDefence Service \u0026 Personnel Records\nFreedom of Information\nInformation Publication Scheme\nPopular publications\nAnnual reports\nBudget\nDefence White Paper\nFOI Disclosures\nInquiry Reports\nPay \u0026 Conditions Manual\nPublications\nIn focus\nPathway to Change\nFighting Fit - ADF Health Portal\nAnzac Centenary\nAnzac Day\nFirst Principles Review\nReport Abuse and Misconduct\nSeMPRO : Victim focused\nFamily and Domestic Violence\nLike the website?\nWe welcome you to take our 20 second survey and help us improve the site.\n \nFeedback\n \nMinister for Defence\nHome page\nBiography\nMedia releases\nSpeeches\nTranscripts\nDefence Service \u0026 Personnel Records\nFreedom of Information\nInformation Publication Scheme\nPopular publications\nAnnual reports\nBudget\nDefence White Paper\nFOI Disclosures\nInquiry Reports\nPay \u0026 Conditions Manual\nPublications\nIn focus\nPathway to Change\nFighting Fit - ADF Health Portal\nAnzac Centenary\nAnzac Day\nFirst Principles Review\nReport Abuse and Misconduct\nSeMPRO : Victim focused\nFamily and Domestic Violence\nLike the website?\nWe welcome you to take our 20 second survey and help us improve the site.\n \nFeedback\n \nMinister for Defence\nHome page\nBiography\nMedia releases\nSpeeches\nTranscripts\nDefending Australia and its National Interests\nContact us\nCopyright\nDisclaimer\nPrivacy\nAccessibility\nSitemap\nError/bug\nToggle responsive view\nBack to top\n","title":"   \t  Maritime Operations and Anti-Submarine Warfare : At a Glance       : Department of Defence","url":"http://defence.gov.au/Whitepaper/AtAGlance/Maritime-Ops.asp","version":1},"task":{"breadth":0,"created":"2018-09-27T21:43:55.534177015Z","depth":0,"host":"defence.gov.au","id":"bemku6ot87468b6omfbg","last_check":"2018-09-27T21:46:14.820275373Z","last_fetch":"2018-09-27T21:46:14.703867657Z","next_check":"2018-09-27T21:56:14.820275373Z","original_url":"http://defence.gov.au/Whitepaper/AtAGlance/Maritime-Ops.asp","reference_url":"http://defence.gov.au/WhitePaper/","schema":"http","snapshot_created":"2018-09-27T21:46:14.703847935Z","snapshot_hash":"56530c14738aca4d2fb8f707895eb5c0afa970c6","snapshot_id":"bemkv9gt8746bdj87oa0","snapshot_version":1,"status":3,"updated":"2018-09-27T21:46:14.683088144Z","url":"http://defence.gov.au/Whitepaper/AtAGlance/Maritime-Ops.asp"}},"fields":{"snapshot.title.keyword":["   \t  Maritime Operations and Anti-Submarine Warfare : At a Glance       : Department of Defence"]},"inner_hits":{"collpased_docs":{"hits":{"total":1,"max_score":1.3814803,"hits":[{"_index":"gopa-index","_type":"doc","_id":"a8eeff92a2a3638bd14c12743072772b","_score":1.3814803,"_source":{"host":"defence.gov.au","snapshot":{"content_type":"text/html","created":"2018-09-27T21:46:14.703847935Z","description":"\nAt a glance.

The Government will invest around 25 percent of Defence capital expenditure to 2025â26 in our maritime capabilities in the most comprehensive regeneration of our Navy since the Second World War. Our maritime forces will become more potent out to the 2030s through more capable submarines, ships and aircraft and better integration of combat and supporting systems across Defence. This will enable our forces to protect our maritime borders and resources, secure our immediate northern approaches and proximate sea lines of communication, and project force in the maritime environment.\nKey maritime operations and antiâsubmarine warfare capabilities\nThe future submarine program is the largest defence procurement in Australiaâs history. A fleet of 12 new regionally superior submarines with a high degree of interoperability with the United States will replace the six current\nCollins\nClass submarines. The new submarines will provide an essential element of Australiaâs deterrent capability. The key roles of the future submarine will include: antiâsubmarine warfare; antiâsurface vessel warfare; intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance; and support to special operations. The results of the competitive evaluation process will be announced this year. The\nCollins\nClass submarine fleet will continue to be supported and upgraded to ensure that it remains a potent capability through the rest of its life and until transition to the new submarine.\nThe new submarines will likely begin to enter service in the early 2030s, with delivery extending over two decades to around 2050. A rolling acquisition program for Australiaâs future submarines will ensure that Australia is able to maintain a fleet of 12 regionally superior submarines as submarine and antiâsubmarine technologies develop over time. As part of a rolling acquisition program, a review of strategic circumstances and developments in submarine technology will be conducted in the late 2020s to consider whether the configuration of the submarines remains suitable or whether consideration of other specifications should commence. A rolling program of acquiring submarines will provide longâterm planning certainty for Australian industry, allowing companies to invest in the capabilities needed to support their involvement in the construction and sustainment activities.\nNine new antiâsubmarine warfare frigates will be introduced into service from the late 2020s, with construction to start in 2020, to replace the existing fleet of eight ANZAC Class frigates. The new frigates will have the range and endurance to operate throughout maritime South East Asia and be deployable from forward bases, such as in the Middle East. They will be equipped with offensive and selfâprotection systems.\nTwelve new offshore patrol vessels (OPV) will begin entering service from the early 2020s, with construction to start in 2018, replacing the 13\nArmidale\nClass patrol boats. The OPVs will have greater reach, endurance and capacity than the\nArmidale\nClass patrol boat fleet, allowing them to perform a broader range of border protection and patrol missions.\nAustraliaâs maritime surveillance and response capability will be significantly enhanced through the Governmentâs acquisition of seven additional Pâ8A Poseidon maritime surveillance and response aircraft to be acquired in two tranches for a total of 15 by the late 2020s.

This force will be achieved through the\nGovernmentâs funding plan, which raises Defence funding to two per cent of Gross Domestic\nProduction by 2020â21. The Defence budget will rise from $32.4 billion in 2016â17 to $58.7 billion in\n2025â26, with approximately $195 billion to be invested in Defence capability over this period.\nMaritime Operations and AntiâSubmarine Warfare\nThe Government will invest around 25 per cent of Defence capability expenditure to 2025â26 in our\nmaritime operations and antiâsubmarine warfare capabilities as part of a significant regeneration of\nour maritime capabilities. Key capabilities will include: 12 new regionally superior submarines; nine\nnew antiâsubmarine warfare frigates; 12 new offshore patrol vessels; seven additional Pâ8A Poseidon\nmaritime surveillance and response aircraft for a total of 15 aircraft by the late 2020s (which will\ncomplement the seven MQâ4C Triton unmanned surveillance aircraft); new maritime tactical\nunmanned aircraft to improve our shipsâ situational awareness on operations; modernised mine\ncountermeasures and hydrographicârelated capabilities; and a new deployable landâbased antiâship\nmissile capability.\nIntelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance, Space, Electronic Warfare and\nCyber Security\nThe Government will invest around nine per cent of Defence capability expenditure to 2025â26 in\nstrengthening our intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance, electronic warfare, space, and cyber\ncapabilities so that our forces have a comprehensive awareness of what is happening around them\nand the ability to respond. Key capabilities will include: enhanced intelligence collection and analysis,\nincluding in support of targeting; enhancements to broad area surveillance through the acquisition\nof the MQâ4C Triton unmanned surveillance aircraft and enhancements to the Jindalee Operational\nRadar Network; strengthened electronic warfare support to naval, air and land forces, including\nthrough the 12 E/Aâ18G Growler electronic attack aircraft and a new long range electronic warfare\nsupport capability based on the Gulfstream G550 airframe, with additional modified systems;\nenhanced space situational awareness; and enhanced cyber capabilities to deter and defend against\nthe threat of cyber attack.\nKey Enablers\nThe Government will invest around 25 per cent of Defence capability expenditure to 2025â26 in the\nenablers that are essential to the operation and sustainment of the ADF. Even the most capable\nplatforms and systems will not be effective without the enabling capabilities that allow those\nplatforms to operate. Key enabling capabilities to receive substantial investment over the next\ndecade include: our people; critical infrastructure such as bases, training ranges, wharves and\nairfields; information and communications technology; simulators; logistics; science and technology;\nhealth services; and strengthening force design, strategic and international policy.\nAir and Sea Lift\nThe Government will invest around six per cent of Defence capability expenditure to 2025â26 in air\nand sea lift capabilities. The long distances over which the ADF is required to operate means flexible\nand high endurance air and sea lift capabilities are essential to lift, move, and sustain the ADF.\nKey capabilities will include: two additional heavyâlift Câ17A Globemaster III transport aircraft\nalready acquired to complement the existing six Câ17A fleet (with consideration of further additional\nheavy lift aircraft at a later stage); two additional KCâ30A airâtoâair refuellers for a total of seven\naircraft (expanding the fleet to nine aircraft will be considered in the longer term); three additional\nCHâ47F Chinook heavyâlift helicopters to complement previously planned CHâ47F Chinook heavyâlift\nhelicopters for a fleet of 10 aircraft, extension and upgrades for the logistics support ship,\nHMAS Choules; two new replenishment ships by 2026 to resupply naval forces with the option for a\nthird replenishment or additional logistics ship in the late 2020s; and a large hulled multiâpurpose\npatrol vessel for the Navy to support border protection and maritime resource security related tasks.\nStrike and Air Combat\nThe Government will invest around 17 per cent of Defence capability expenditure to 2025â26 in our\nstrike and air combat capabilities. More potent strike capabilities will provide flexibility for the ADF\nto rapidly respond to threats against Australia and provide military contributions to support regional\nsecurity and coalition operations globally where our interests are engaged. Key capabilities will\ninclude: 72 Fâ35A Lightning II Joint Strike Fighters to enter service from 2020 to replace the current\nfleet of 71 F/Aâ18A/B Classic Hornets; 12 EAâ18G Growler electronic attack aircraft to enter service\nfrom 2018; new airâtoâsurface, airâtoâair and highâspeed and longârange strike and antiâship\nweapons; and strengthened command and control, integrated air and missile defence, and\nsituational awareness capabilities to support strike and air combat operations.\nLand Combat and Amphibious Warfare\nThe Government will invest around 18 per cent of Defence capability expenditure to 2025â26 in our\nland combat and amphibious warfare capabilities to provide greater mobility, firepower, protection\nand situational awareness.

The Government will invest around 17 per cent of Defence capital expenditure in our strike and air combat capabilities to 2025â26. More potent strike capabilities will provide flexibility for the Australian Defence Force (ADF) to rapidly respond to threats against Australia and provide military contributions to support regional security and coalition operations globally, where our interests are engaged.\nThe ADF will be equipped with a potent and technologically advanced air combat and strike capability, building on the current fleet of 24 F/Aâ18F Super Hornets, 71 F/Aâ18A/B Classic Hornets, and six Eâ7A Wedgetail airborne early warning and control aircraft.\nKey Strike and Air Combat capabilities\nThe Government will ensure that the ADF has the most capable weapons to fulfil its strike and air combat missions in the future. A series of new airâtoâsurface, airâtoâair and highâspeed and longârange strike and antiâship weapons will be acquired for the strike and air combat capability.\nThe ADFâs integrated air and missile defence system will also be enhanced to improve the accuracy and speed of ADF systemsâ response to air and missile threats, and to integrate and share air and space surveillance information more effectively. The Government will increase investment in capabilities to better connect the communications, sensor and targeting systems of various platforms so that they can more effectively combine their capabilities, generating greater potency and lethality. The ADFâs enhanced integrated air and missile defence capabilities will have the flexibility for further enhancement to handle more complex threats that may emerge in the future.\nDefence will also acquire groundâbased active electronically scanned array radars from around 2020 and expand Australiaâs access to air and space situational awareness information, including through spaceâbased systems.\nThe Government will also introduce a more sophisticated groundâbased air defence system to replace the shortârange RBSâ70 missile system. A new manâportable shortârange system will be introduced by the early 2020s, and will be supplemented by an advanced tactical and mediumârange surfaceâtoâair missile system in the mid to late 2020s, providing layered airâdefence against a broad range of capable air threats.\nThe 72 fifth generation Fâ35A Lightning II Joint Strike Fighters will enter service from 2020 to replace the F/Aâ18A/B Classic Hornets. The Joint Strike Fighters will use a mix of airâtoâair and airâtoâsurface weapons, operate at extended range, maintaining stealth, providing a true multiârole capability. The 24 F/Aâ18F Super Hornets will complement the Joint Strike Fighter aircraft. The Super Hornets will be able to strike potential adversary targets, control the air, and enable ADF or coalition maritime or land operations to proceed unhindered. After 2020, the Government will consider options to replace the Super Hornets in around 2030.\nThe 12 E/Aâ18G Growler electronic attack aircraft will enter service from 2018. The aircraft will provide a unique capability to disrupt, disable or confuse adversariesâ electronic systems such as radars and communications systems. The six inâservice Eâ7A Wedgetail airborne early warning and control aircraft will continue to be upgraded in order to maintain their capability edge to the mid 2030s.\nPeople\nApproximately, an additional 500 ADF positions will be allocated to 2025â26 to support the introduction of more potent strike and air combat capabilities.\nInfrastructure\nThe Government will make a significant investment in new infrastructure and facilities to 2025â26 to support the ADFâs strike and air combat capabilities. This will include upgrades to facilities at Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) bases Darwin and Tindal, Northern Territory; RAAF bases Amberley, Townsville and Scherger, Queensland; RAAF Williamtown, New South Wales; RAAF Edinburgh, South Australia; and RAAF bases Pearce, Learmonth and Curtin in Western Australia.\nDefence Service \u0026 Personnel Records\nFreedom of Information\nInformation Publication Scheme\nPopular publications\nAnnual reports\nBudget\nDefence White Paper\nFOI Disclosures\nInquiry Reports\nPay \u0026 Conditions Manual\nPublications\nIn focus\nPathway to Change\nFighting Fit - ADF Health Portal\nAnzac Centenary\nAnzac Day\nFirst Principles Review\nReport Abuse and Misconduct\nSeMPRO : Victim focused\nFamily and Domestic Violence\nLike the website?\nWe welcome you to take our 20 second survey and help us improve the site.\n \nFeedback\n \nMinister for Defence\nHome page\nBiography\nMedia releases\nSpeeches\nTranscripts\nDefence Service \u0026 Personnel Records\nFreedom of Information\nInformation Publication Scheme\nPopular publications\nAnnual reports\nBudget\nDefence White Paper\nFOI Disclosures\nInquiry Reports\nPay \u0026 Conditions Manual\nPublications\nIn focus\nPathway to Change\nFighting Fit - ADF Health Portal\nAnzac Centenary\nAnzac Day\nFirst Principles Review\nReport Abuse and Misconduct\nSeMPRO : Victim focused\nFamily and Domestic Violence\nLike the website?\nWe welcome you to take our 20 second survey and help us improve the site.\n \nFeedback\n \nMinister for Defence\nHome page\nBiography\nMedia releases\nSpeeches\nTranscripts\nDefending Australia and its National Interests\nContact us\nCopyright\nDisclaimer\nPrivacy\nAccessibility\nSitemap\nError/bug\nToggle responsive view\nBack to top\n","title":"   \t  Strike and Air Combat : At a Glance       : Department of Defence","url":"http://defence.gov.au/Whitepaper/AtAGlance/Strike-Air-Combat.asp","version":1},"task":{"breadth":0,"created":"2018-09-27T21:43:56.016775231Z","depth":0,"host":"defence.gov.au","id":"bemku70t87468b6omfrg","last_check":"2018-09-27T21:46:16.184457373Z","last_fetch":"2018-09-27T21:46:15.94872182Z","next_check":"2018-09-27T21:56:16.184457373Z","original_url":"http://defence.gov.au/Whitepaper/AtAGlance/Strike-Air-Combat.asp","reference_url":"http://defence.gov.au/WhitePaper/","schema":"http","snapshot_created":"2018-09-27T21:46:15.948696287Z","snapshot_hash":"7ccaa780df0ec6779d42a5ed53145ec4f013101d","snapshot_id":"bemkv9ot8746bdj87u2g","snapshot_version":1,"status":3,"updated":"2018-09-27T21:46:15.937211379Z","url":"http://defence.gov.au/Whitepaper/AtAGlance/Strike-Air-Combat.asp"}},"fields":{"snapshot.title.keyword":["   \t  Strike and Air Combat : At a Glance       : Department of Defence"]},"inner_hits":{"collpased_docs":{"hits":{"total":1,"max_score":2.0326936,"hits":[{"_index":"gopa-index","_type":"doc","_id":"08307224bdadea2160b25f6430b50592","_score":2.0326936,"_source":{"host":"defence.gov.au","snapshot":{"content_type":"text/html","created":"2018-09-27T21:46:15.948696287Z","description":"\nAt a glance.

The Government will invest around 17 per cent of Defence capital expenditure in our strike and air combat capabilities to 2025â26. More potent strike capabilities will provide flexibility for the Australian Defence Force (ADF) to rapidly respond to threats against Australia and provide military contributions to support regional security and coalition operations globally, where our interests are engaged.\nThe ADF will be equipped with a potent and technologically advanced air combat and strike capability, building on the current fleet of 24 F/Aâ18F Super Hornets, 71 F/Aâ18A/B Classic Hornets, and six Eâ7A Wedgetail airborne early warning and control aircraft.\nKey Strike and Air Combat capabilities\nThe Government will ensure that the ADF has the most capable weapons to fulfil its strike and air combat missions in the future. A series of new airâtoâsurface, airâtoâair and highâspeed and longârange strike and antiâship weapons will be acquired for the strike and air combat capability.\nThe ADFâs integrated air and missile defence system will also be enhanced to improve the accuracy and speed of ADF systemsâ response to air and missile threats, and to integrate and share air and space surveillance information more effectively. The Government will increase investment in capabilities to better connect the communications, sensor and targeting systems of various platforms so that they can more effectively combine their capabilities, generating greater potency and lethality. The ADFâs enhanced integrated air and missile defence capabilities will have the flexibility for further enhancement to handle more complex threats that may emerge in the future.\nDefence will also acquire groundâbased active electronically scanned array radars from around 2020 and expand Australiaâs access to air and space situational awareness information, including through spaceâbased systems.\nThe Government will also introduce a more sophisticated groundâbased air defence system to replace the shortârange RBSâ70 missile system.

The Government will invest around six per cent of Defence capability expenditure to 2025â26 in our air and sea lift capabilities. Given the substantial distances over which the Australian Defence Force (ADF) must operate â nationally, regionally and globally â air and sea lift capabilities are essential. A flexible force of air and sea lift capabilities will enable the ADF to reach, resupply and sustain missions in different locations. The ADF also needs to have lift capacity to be highly mobile within any area of operation.\nKey air and sea lift capabilities\nThe ADFâs strategic transport capability will be greatly enhanced through the already delivered acquisition of two additional heavyâlift Câ17A Globemaster transport aircraft, capable of moving large cargo and numbers of personnel great distances, such as from Australia to the Middle East, increasing our fleet to eight aircraft. Additional heavy lift aircraft will be considered at a later stage.\nThe Government will extend the range of combat and surveillance aircraft, acquiring two additional KCâ30A airâtoâair refuellers before the end of this decade for a total of seven aircraft. Expanding the fleet to nine aircraft in the longer term will be considered to meet increasing demand.\nOur Chinook helicopters are a workhorse of the ADF, capable of moving stores and personnel, including vehicles and artillery around the battlefield or from ships to the land without the need for an airfield as well as undertaking aeroâmedical evacuation. The Government will acquire three additional CHâ47F Chinook heavyâlift helicopters in the near term to expand battlefield lift capacity and support tactical missions including aeroâmedical evacuation for a total of 10 helicopters.\nThe logistics support ship, HMAS Choules, and the two Canberra Class amphibious ships, will provide scalable and flexible options for greater capacity sea lift and amphibious operations. The Government will extend the life of HMAS Choules and update the capabilities onboard, including modern self defence and aviation support systems until it is replaced around 2030.\nIn addition, the Government will acquire a new large hulled multiâpurpose patrol vessel, the Australian Defence Vessel Ocean Protector for the Navy to support border protection and maritime resource security related tasks with the Australian Border Force.\nSustainment of our maritime capabilities will be improved by two new replenishment vessels that will begin service by 2026. The vessels will provide naval combat units with fuel, water and stores while underway at sea. A third replenishment vessel or additional logistics support ship will be acquired the late 2020s.\nTogether, HMAS\nChoules\n, the amphibious ships, and replenishment vessels, will enable the ADF to conduct a greater number of challenging maritime operations at the same time, and to sustain those operations for longer periods than we can today.\nThe Government will acquire enhanced aeroâmedical evacuation and search and rescue capabilities for our forces, with upgrades to aeroâmedical equipment for the Chinook helicopters commencing from 2016. In the longer term, options will be investigated for a dedicated longârange combat search and rescue capability.\nThe Government will upgrade the 12 Câ130J Hercules medium transport aircraft to ensure that they can continue to fulfil their critical role in moving stores and equipment within our region when required.\n10 Câ27J Spartan medium transport aircraft are currently being introduced into service. The Spartans will enhance the ADFâs air lift capability, providing a unique capacity to move personnel and small cargos to remote locations using shorter landing strips not suitable for any other fixed wing military aircraft in the ADF fleet.\nThe MRHâ90 Troop lift helicopter will continue to be introduced into service, with Army to operate 39 to 41 aircraft and Navy to operate up to eight aircraft. The aircraft will be a force multiplier for Army in tactical air mobility and for Navy in maritime support.

The Government will invest around six per cent of Defence capability expenditure to 2025â26 in our air and sea lift capabilities. Given the substantial distances over which the Australian Defence Force (ADF) must operate â nationally, regionally and globally â air and sea lift capabilities are essential. A flexible force of air and sea lift capabilities will enable the ADF to reach, resupply and sustain missions in different locations. The ADF also needs to have lift capacity to be highly mobile within any area of operation.\nKey air and sea lift capabilities\nThe ADFâs strategic transport capability will be greatly enhanced through the already delivered acquisition of two additional heavyâlift Câ17A Globemaster transport aircraft, capable of moving large cargo and numbers of personnel great distances, such as from Australia to the Middle East, increasing our fleet to eight aircraft. Additional heavy lift aircraft will be considered at a later stage.\nThe Government will extend the range of combat and surveillance aircraft, acquiring two additional KCâ30A airâtoâair refuellers before the end of this decade for a total of seven aircraft. Expanding the fleet to nine aircraft in the longer term will be considered to meet increasing demand.\nOur Chinook helicopters are a workhorse of the ADF, capable of moving stores and personnel, including vehicles and artillery around the battlefield or from ships to the land without the need for an airfield as well as undertaking aeroâmedical evacuation. The Government will acquire three additional CHâ47F Chinook heavyâlift helicopters in the near term to expand battlefield lift capacity and support tactical missions including aeroâmedical evacuation for a total of 10 helicopters.\nThe logistics support ship, HMAS Choules, and the two Canberra Class amphibious ships, will provide scalable and flexible options for greater capacity sea lift and amphibious operations. The Government will extend the life of HMAS Choules and update the capabilities onboard, including modern self defence and aviation support systems until it is replaced around 2030.\nIn addition, the Government will acquire a new large hulled multiâpurpose patrol vessel, the Australian Defence Vessel Ocean Protector for the Navy to support border protection and maritime resource security related tasks with the Australian Border Force.\nSustainment of our maritime capabilities will be improved by two new replenishment vessels that will begin service by 2026. The vessels will provide naval combat units with fuel, water and stores while underway at sea. A third replenishment vessel or additional logistics support ship will be acquired the late 2020s.\nTogether, HMAS\nChoules\n, the amphibious ships, and replenishment vessels, will enable the ADF to conduct a greater number of challenging maritime operations at the same time, and to sustain those operations for longer periods than we can today.\nThe Government will acquire enhanced aeroâmedical evacuation and search and rescue capabilities for our forces, with upgrades to aeroâmedical equipment for the Chinook helicopters commencing from 2016. In the longer term, options will be investigated for a dedicated longârange combat search and rescue capability.\nThe Government will upgrade the 12 Câ130J Hercules medium transport aircraft to ensure that they can continue to fulfil their critical role in moving stores and equipment within our region when required.\n10 Câ27J Spartan medium transport aircraft are currently being introduced into service. The Spartans will enhance the ADFâs air lift capability, providing a unique capacity to move personnel and small cargos to remote locations using shorter landing strips not suitable for any other fixed wing military aircraft in the ADF fleet.\nThe MRHâ90 Troop lift helicopter will continue to be introduced into service, with Army to operate 39 to 41 aircraft and Navy to operate up to eight aircraft. The aircraft will be a force multiplier for Army in tactical air mobility and for Navy in maritime support. Current plans include a requirement for roleâspecific upgrades to the MRHâ90 Troop lift helicopter to replace the Sâ70A Blackhawk in support of domestic counter terrorism operations.\nPeople\nAn additional around 800 ADF positions will be allocated to 2025â26 to assist with the air and sea lift fleets, including introduction of the two additional heavy lift Câ17A Globemaster transport aircraft, two additional airâtoâair refuelling aircraft, 10 Câ27J Spartan medium transport aircraft, two new replenishment vessels, and three additional CHâ47 Chinook heavyâlift helicopters.\nInfrastructure\nSubstantial investment in support of air lift is programmed for upgraded infrastructure at RAAF Base Amberley, Queensland, including facilities to support an increased number of tactical, medium and strategic lift aircraft.

The Defence Industry Policy Statement provides the foundation to take the partnerships between Defence and industry to new levels of cooperation, with a focus on stronger, more strategic\npartnerships and closer alignment between industry investment and Defence capability needs. Initiatives in the Defence Industry Policy Statement will see the development of a technologically advanced, innovationâdriven and sustainable Australian defence industrial base, which is well placed to assist Defence in protecting Australiaâs national interests.\nDelivering Defence Capability\nThe Governmentâs 10âyear Defence budget plan to 2025â26 grows the Defence budget from $32.4 billion in 2016â17 to $58.7 billion in 2025â26, providing an additional $29.9 billion to Defence over this period than previously planned. The Government will invest approximately $195 billion in Defence capability to 2025â26, restoring confidence in Defenceâs long term funding.\nFor the first time, the 2016 Integrated Investment Program released with the Defence White Paper brings together all elements of Defence investment, including equipment, facilities, workforce, and information and communications technology as well as major weapons, platforms and systems. Australian industry now has the clarity and certainty to invest in the people and infrastructure to make these capability plans a reality.\nThe 2016 Defence Industry Policy Statement, the First Principles Review and the Governmentâs decisions on naval shipbuilding, reinforce the importance of treating Australian industry as a fundamental input to capability. It will be mandatory for Defence to consider Australian industry in the formal capability development process. This will help industry to better match specialist skills and advances in science and technology to develop innovative solutions for new capabilities.\nStrategic Partnership with Industry\nThe Government places a high priority on maximising the innovation potential of the Australian economy. Innovation will be reâpositioned as an essential driver to generate new capabilities for Defence and new opportunities for Australian industry. The Governmentâs Defence Industry Policy Statement complements the 2015 National Innovation and Science Agenda, with a focus on maximising the delivery of Defence capability through a more focused, coordinated and transparent effort between Defence and industry. The Statement will transform Defenceâs approach to innovation, and create a seamless link between capability needs, smart ideas and innovation in Australian industry. New initiatives will harness Australiaâs potential for innovation by streamlining engagement with industry, academic and research organisations, and by establishing a single endâtoend\ninnovation pipeline with a clear path to commercialisation.\nHarnessing Australian Innovation in the Defence Sector\nThe Government is committed to maximising opportunities for competitive Australian businesses; building export potential, depth of skills and diversification for defence industry, and cutting red tape to make it simpler and less costly for Australian industry to support Defence.\nThe initiatives in this Statement will bring Defence and industry closer together and drive the changes we need to ensure industry becomes more competitive and highly skilled, and to encourage investment both at the local and international level.\nThe new Defence Industry Policy Statement centres on two key initiatives: the Centre for Defence Industry Capability and a new approach to Defence innovation. These initiatives will deliver around $1.6 billion in investment in Defenceârelated innovation to 2025â26, supporting Australian science and technology and innovation to provide advanced homeâgrown Defence capabilities.\nThe Centre for Defence Industry Capability will be funded at around $230 million to 2025â26. The Centre will promote defence industry competitiveness, guide the priorities across defence industry, and connect Defence capability with innovation.\nAround $730 million to 2025â26 will be provided for research on next generation technologies with the potential to deliver gameâchanging capabilities critical to defence and national security.\nThe Defence Innovation Hub (the Hub) will be a virtual network, funded at around $640 million to 2025â26 to bring together Defenceâs innovation programs. The Hub will enable defence industry to collaborate on innovation efforts that deliver a capability edge throughout the capability life cycle from initial concept, through prototyping and testing to introduction into service.\nThe Defence Innovation Portal, as part of the Centre for Defence Industry Capability, will be a key communication bridge between Defence, industry and academia, providing vital connections between small to medium enterprises and Defence.\nA Strong and Sustainable Australian Naval Shipbuilding Industry\nA strong, viable and sustainable Australian naval shipbuilding industry is a vital element of Australiaâs defence capability to manage Australiaâs strategic challenges to 2035. The Government is delivering a longâterm plan to ensure retention of a sovereign Australian naval shipbuilding industry and the jobs that go with it. The Governmentâs strategy is centred on a longâterm continuous build of major warships and minor naval vessels in Australia.\nIn the short term, the continuous build strategy will sustain around 1,000 jobs that would otherwise have been lost, and will guarantee around 2,500 longâterm Australian surface shipbuilding jobs for decades to come. This strategy will transform Australiaâs shipbuilding industry and put an end to the boomâbust cycle that has afflicted the industry, and has led to the current shipbuilding âvalley of deathâ. The Government is confident in the ability of Australian defence industry to play its part in moving to a continuous build program for naval surface ships, which will require unprecedented reform of the Australian naval shipbuilding industry focused on significant improvements in productivity.\nDefence Service \u0026 Personnel Records\nFreedom of Information\nInformation Publication Scheme\nPopular publications\nAnnual reports\nBudget\nDefence White Paper\nFOI Disclosures\nInquiry Reports\nPay \u0026 Conditions Manual\nPublications\nIn focus\nPathway to Change\nFighting Fit - ADF Health Portal\nAnzac Centenary\nAnzac Day\nFirst Principles Review\nReport Abuse and Misconduct\nSeMPRO : Victim focused\nFamily and Domestic Violence\nLike the website?\nWe welcome you to take our 20 second survey and help us improve the site.\n \nFeedback\n \nMinister for Defence\nHome page\nBiography\nMedia releases\nSpeeches\nTranscripts\nDefence Service \u0026 Personnel Records\nFreedom of Information\nInformation Publication Scheme\nPopular publications\nAnnual reports\nBudget\nDefence White Paper\nFOI Disclosures\nInquiry Reports\nPay \u0026 Conditions Manual\nPublications\nIn focus\nPathway to Change\nFighting Fit - ADF Health Portal\nAnzac Centenary\nAnzac Day\nFirst Principles Review\nReport Abuse and Misconduct\nSeMPRO : Victim focused\nFamily and Domestic Violence\nLike the website?\nWe welcome you to take our 20 second survey and help us improve the site.\n \nFeedback\n \nMinister for Defence\nHome page\nBiography\nMedia releases\nSpeeches\nTranscripts\nDefending Australia and its National Interests\nContact us\nCopyright\nDisclaimer\nPrivacy\nAccessibility\nSitemap\nError/bug\nToggle responsive view\nBack to top\n","title":"   \t  Defence Industry : At a Glance       : Department of Defence","url":"http://defence.gov.au/Whitepaper/AtAGlance/Defence-Industry.asp","version":1},"task":{"breadth":0,"created":"2018-09-27T21:43:55.534336782Z","depth":0,"host":"defence.gov.au","id":"bemku6ot87468b6omfc0","last_check":"2018-09-27T21:46:15.027530355Z","last_fetch":"2018-09-27T21:46:14.757990215Z","next_check":"2018-09-27T21:56:15.027530355Z","original_url":"http://defence.gov.au/Whitepaper/AtAGlance/Defence-Industry.asp","reference_url":"http://defence.gov.au/WhitePaper/","schema":"http","snapshot_created":"2018-09-27T21:46:14.757960453Z","snapshot_hash":"79ffecfdb17899acfdb55d81696e06a8384a7d85","snapshot_id":"bemkv9gt8746bdj87oag","snapshot_version":1,"status":3,"updated":"2018-09-27T21:46:14.703613283Z","url":"http://defence.gov.au/Whitepaper/AtAGlance/Defence-Industry.asp"}},"fields":{"snapshot.title.keyword":["   \t  Defence Industry : At a Glance       : Department of Defence"]},"inner_hits":{"collpased_docs":{"hits":{"total":1,"max_score":1.4586792,"hits":[{"_index":"gopa-index","_type":"doc","_id":"e2edd4c2a6d14fd3a1088a57da104e74","_score":1.4586792,"_source":{"host":"defence.gov.au","snapshot":{"content_type":"text/html","created":"2018-09-27T21:46:14.757960453Z","description":"\nAt a glance.

The Defence Industry Policy Statement provides the foundation to take the partnerships between Defence and industry to new levels of cooperation, with a focus on stronger, more strategic\npartnerships and closer alignment between industry investment and Defence capability needs. Initiatives in the Defence Industry Policy Statement will see the development of a technologically advanced, innovationâdriven and sustainable Australian defence industrial base, which is well placed to assist Defence in protecting Australiaâs national interests.\nDelivering Defence Capability\nThe Governmentâs 10âyear Defence budget plan to 2025â26 grows the Defence budget from $32.4 billion in 2016â17 to $58.7 billion in 2025â26, providing an additional $29.9 billion to Defence over this period than previously planned. The Government will invest approximately $195 billion in Defence capability to 2025â26, restoring confidence in Defenceâs long term funding.\nFor the first time, the 2016 Integrated Investment Program released with the Defence White Paper brings together all elements of Defence investment, including equipment, facilities, workforce, and information and communications technology as well as major weapons, platforms and systems. Australian industry now has the clarity and certainty to invest in the people and infrastructure to make these capability plans a reality.\nThe 2016 Defence Industry Policy Statement, the First Principles Review and the Governmentâs decisions on naval shipbuilding, reinforce the importance of treating Australian industry as a fundamental input to capability. It will be mandatory for Defence to consider Australian industry in the formal capability development process. This will help industry to better match specialist skills and advances in science and technology to develop innovative solutions for new capabilities.\nStrategic Partnership with Industry\nThe Government places a high priority on maximising the innovation potential of the Australian economy. Innovation will be reâpositioned as an essential driver to generate new capabilities for Defence and new opportunities for Australian industry. The Governmentâs Defence Industry Policy Statement complements the 2015 National Innovation and Science Agenda, with a focus on maximising the delivery of Defence capability through a more focused, coordinated and transparent effort between Defence and industry. The Statement will transform Defenceâs approach to innovation, and create a seamless link between capability needs, smart ideas and innovation in Australian industry. New initiatives will harness Australiaâs potential for innovation by streamlining engagement with industry, academic and research organisations, and by establishing a single endâtoend\ninnovation pipeline with a clear path to commercialisation.\nHarnessing Australian Innovation in the Defence Sector\nThe Government is committed to maximising opportunities for competitive Australian businesses; building export potential, depth of skills and diversification for defence industry, and cutting red tape to make it simpler and less costly for Australian industry to support Defence.\nThe initiatives in this Statement will bring Defence and industry closer together and drive the changes we need to ensure industry becomes more competitive and highly skilled, and to encourage investment both at the local and international level.\nThe new Defence Industry Policy Statement centres on two key initiatives: the Centre for Defence Industry Capability and a new approach to Defence innovation. These initiatives will deliver around $1.6 billion in investment in Defenceârelated innovation to 2025â26, supporting Australian science and technology and innovation to provide advanced homeâgrown Defence capabilities.\nThe Centre for Defence Industry Capability will be funded at around $230 million to 2025â26. The Centre will promote defence industry competitiveness, guide the priorities across defence industry, and connect Defence capability with innovation.\nAround $730 million to 2025â26 will be provided for research on next generation technologies with the potential to deliver gameâchanging capabilities critical to defence and national security.\nThe Defence Innovation Hub (the Hub) will be a virtual network, funded at around $640 million to 2025â26 to bring together Defenceâs innovation programs. The Hub will enable defence industry to collaborate on innovation efforts that deliver a capability edge throughout the capability life cycle from initial concept, through prototyping and testing to introduction into service.\nThe Defence Innovation Portal, as part of the Centre for Defence Industry Capability, will be a key communication bridge between Defence, industry and academia, providing vital connections between small to medium enterprises and Defence.\nA Strong and Sustainable Australian Naval Shipbuilding Industry\nA strong, viable and sustainable Australian naval shipbuilding industry is a vital element of Australiaâs defence capability to manage Australiaâs strategic challenges to 2035. The Government is delivering a longâterm plan to ensure retention of a sovereign Australian naval shipbuilding industry and the jobs that go with it. The Governmentâs strategy is centred on a longâterm continuous build of major warships and minor naval vessels in Australia.\nIn the short term, the continuous build strategy will sustain around 1,000 jobs that would otherwise have been lost, and will guarantee around 2,500 longâterm Australian surface shipbuilding jobs for decades to come. This strategy will transform Australiaâs shipbuilding industry and put an end to the boomâbust cycle that has afflicted the industry, and has led to the current shipbuilding âvalley of deathâ. The Government is confident in the ability of Australian defence industry to play its part in moving to a continuous build program for naval surface ships, which will require unprecedented reform of the Australian naval shipbuilding industry focused on significant improvements in productivity.\nDefence Service \u0026 Personnel Records\nFreedom of Information\nInformation Publication Scheme\nPopular publications\nAnnual reports\nBudget\nDefence White Paper\nFOI Disclosures\nInquiry Reports\nPay \u0026 Conditions Manual\nPublications\nIn focus\nPathway to Change\nFighting Fit -

The Government will invest around 18 percent of Defence capital expenditure to 2025â26 in our land combat and amphibious warfare capabilities through greater situational awareness, firepower, protection, mobility and force sustainability. These enhancements will increase Australiaâs capacity for both combat and noncombat operations, including for security and stabilisation operations and the provision of humanitarian assistance and disaster relief.\nKey land combat and amphibious warfare capabilities\nAustralian soldiers will continue to receive the worldâclass equipment, weapons systems and protection they need to undertake their important roles. Key weapons systems to be acquired include: new rifles and pistols; direct fire support weapons, including those used against armoured vehicles, bunkers and installations; and indirect weapons such as mortars. New improved personal protection equipment will be acquired, such as body armour, nightâfighting equipment, and protective equipment to mitigate chemical, biological and radiological threats. Defence will continuously monitor, adapt and improve the personal equipment and weapons systems to respond quickly to evolving operational requirements.\nNew combat reconnaissance, infantry fighting, new generation armoured and protected mobility fleets and upgrades to the M1 Abrams Main Battle Tanks will ensure our forces have the protection, mobility and firepower they need to defeat potential adversaries on the future battlefield. On 5 October, 2015, the Government announced acquisition of 1,100 locally built Hawkei protected vehicles and over 1,000 trailers.\nOur land forces will have unprecedented knowledge of what is happening around them and the firepower to respond. A new armed intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR) unmanned aircraft capability is programmed for the early 2020s, to facilitate the timely delivery of accurate information to commanders at all levels, and provide superior situational awareness to inform decisionâmaking. This capability will enhance the Australian Defence Forceâs counterâterrorism support capability overseas and could augment search and rescue, humanitarian assistance and disaster relief and coastal surveillance. New small unmanned aircraft will provide better realâtime ISR support to tactical commanders.\nA new long range rocket system will be acquired in the midâ2020s to provide additional firepower at greater distances (up to around 300km) to complement our existing artillery capability. Our 22 Tiger Armed Reconnaissance helicopters, which provide firepower for our land force operations, will be replaced from the mid 2020s by manned or unmanned systems, or a combination of both, depending on technological developments.\nNew protected and unprotected engineering platforms including cranes, excavators, front end loaders, forklifts, and tractors; armoured bridging and breaching platforms; aviation and fire trucks; and other support capabilities will be acquired over the next decade to support our forces.\nBattlefield logistic support to our troops will be enhanced, including deployable logistics information systems, and replacement of maritime transport vessels. A riverine patrol capability will be reâestablished through a fleet of lightly armed boats from around 2022 to allow operations in estuarine environments. New deployable land communication networks, including satellite and terrestrial communications, will equip our forces with the communications capabilities they need for future operations.\nAmphibious capability\nAustraliaâs strengthened amphibious capability centres around our new\nCanberra\nClass amphibious ships, which will provide the ADF with an unprecedented capability to conduct a wide range of operations in the maritime environment. These amphibious ships will enable the ADF to land a sizeable force of personnel and equipment across a broad spectrum of operations. The\nCanberra\nClass shipsâ onâboard hospital and their ability to operate without wharves or port infrastructure will be a major asset in support of both domestic and international disaster recovery missions. Over time, the capability of the ships will be enhanced to better support joint command and control, including upgrades to communications and intelligence systems and semiâautonomous self defence capabilities. In the longer term, we will replace the shipsâ landing craft used to transport people and equipment from ship to shore. Together with our logistics support ship, HMAS\nChoules\n, the amphibious ships will provide scalable and flexible options for amphibious operations and sea lift.\nSpecial Forces\nAustraliaâs Special Forces undertake complex tactical operations across a range of combat environments. This includes a range of specialist response options when deployed overseas, such as supporting air strikes, reconnaissance and rescue missions. Special Forces are also responsible for domestic counterâterrorism roles when required. Our capability will be significantly enhanced with new highâend weapons, improved mission command networks and situational awareness tools, enhanced tactical mobility, specialised force protection, and logistic support capabilities. The Government will also deliver a new fleet of light helicopters (which are rapidly deployable by transport aircraft) from the midâ2020s to enhance mobility for special operations missions.\nPeople\nAround 700 additional ADF positions will be allocated to 2025â26 to support our strengthened land combat and amphibious warfare capabilities.\nInfrastructure\nWe will upgrade bases including in Brisbane, Darwin, Sydney, Puckapunyal in Victoria, and Townsville, and weapon ranges and training areas such as Puckapunyal and Shoalwater Bay, Queensland to 2025â26. Upgrades to HMAS Stirling in Perth and Fleet Base East (Garden Island) in Sydney will support the amphibious ships. New facilities will support new unmanned aircraft, including at Royal Australian Air Force bases Townsville and Tindal, Northern Territory; Shoalwater Bay; and at the Cultana and Woomera ranges in South Australia.\nDefence Service \u0026 Personnel Records\nFreedom of Information\nInformation Publication Scheme\nPopular publications\nAnnual reports\nBudget\nDefence White Paper\nFOI Disclosures\nInquiry Reports\nPay \u0026 Conditions Manual\nPublications\nIn focus\nPathway to Change\nFighting Fit - ADF Health Portal\nAnzac Centenary\nAnzac Day\nFirst Principles Review\nReport Abuse and Misconduct\nSeMPRO : Victim focused\nFamily and Domestic Violence\nLike the website?\nWe welcome you to take our 20 second survey and help us improve the site.\n \nFeedback\n \nMinister for Defence\nHome page\nBiography\nMedia releases\nSpeeches\nTranscripts\nDefence Service \u0026 Personnel Records\nFreedom of Information\nInformation Publication Scheme\nPopular publications\nAnnual reports\nBudget\nDefence White Paper\nFOI Disclosures\nInquiry Reports\nPay \u0026 Conditions Manual\nPublications\nIn focus\nPathway to Change\nFighting Fit - ADF Health Portal\nAnzac Centenary\nAnzac Day\nFirst Principles Review\nReport Abuse and Misconduct\nSeMPRO : Victim focused\nFamily and Domestic Violence\nLike the website?\nWe welcome you to take our 20 second survey and help us improve the site.\n \nFeedback\n \nMinister for Defence\nHome page\nBiography\nMedia releases\nSpeeches\nTranscripts\nDefending Australia and its National Interests\nContact us\nCopyright\nDisclaimer\nPrivacy\nAccessibility\nSitemap\nError/bug\nToggle responsive view\nBack to top\n","title":"   \t  Land Combat and Amphibious Warfare : At a Glance       : Department of Defence","url":"http://defence.gov.au/Whitepaper/AtAGlance/Land-Combat-Amphib.asp","version":1},"task":{"breadth":0,"created":"2018-09-27T21:43:56.019505784Z","depth":0,"host":"defence.gov.au","id":"bemku70t87468b6omfug","last_check":"2018-09-27T21:46:16.340332338Z","last_fetch":"2018-09-27T21:46:15.992110815Z","next_check":"2018-09-27T21:56:16.340332338Z","original_url":"http://defence.gov.au/Whitepaper/AtAGlance/Land-Combat-Amphib.asp","reference_url":"http://defence.gov.au/WhitePaper/","schema":"http","snapshot_created":"2018-09-27T21:46:15.992087233Z","snapshot_hash":"5a6fcbcdfc8e99f5dfe274fb65b632614c01b22e","snapshot_id":"bemkv9ot8746bdj87u5g","snapshot_version":1,"status":3,"updated":"2018-09-27T21:46:15.982759857Z","url":"http://defence.gov.au/Whitepaper/AtAGlance/Land-Combat-Amphib.asp"}},"fields":{"snapshot.title.keyword":["   \t  Land Combat and Amphibious Warfare : At a Glance       : Department of Defence"]},"inner_hits":{"collpased_docs":{"hits":{"total":1,"max_score":1.3814803,"hits":[{"_index":"gopa-index","_type":"doc","_id":"bd8dd3363ee9467e934451bb904a5425","_score":1.3814803,"_source":{"host":"defence.gov.au","snapshot":{"content_type":"text/html","created":"2018-09-27T21:46:15.992087233Z","description":"\nAt a glance.

The Government will invest around 18 percent of Defence capital expenditure to 2025â26 in our land combat and amphibious warfare capabilities through greater situational awareness, firepower, protection, mobility and force sustainability. These enhancements will increase Australiaâs capacity for both combat and noncombat operations, including for security and stabilisation operations and the provision of humanitarian assistance and disaster relief.\nKey land combat and amphibious warfare capabilities\nAustralian soldiers will continue to receive the worldâclass equipment, weapons systems and protection they need to undertake their important roles. Key weapons systems to be acquired include: new rifles and pistols; direct fire support weapons, including those used against armoured vehicles, bunkers and installations; and indirect weapons such as mortars. New improved personal protection equipment will be acquired, such as body armour, nightâfighting equipment, and protective equipment to mitigate chemical, biological and radiological threats. Defence will continuously monitor, adapt and improve the personal equipment and weapons systems to respond quickly to evolving operational requirements.\nNew combat reconnaissance, infantry fighting, new generation armoured and protected mobility fleets and upgrades to the M1 Abrams Main Battle Tanks will ensure our forces have the protection, mobility and firepower they need to defeat potential adversaries on the future battlefield.

The Government will invest around 25 percent of Defence capital expenditure to 2025â26 in our maritime capabilities in the most comprehensive regeneration of our Navy since the Second World War. Our maritime forces will become more potent out to the 2030s through more capable submarines, ships and aircraft and better integration of combat and supporting systems across Defence. This will enable our forces to protect our maritime borders and resources, secure our immediate northern approaches and proximate sea lines of communication, and project force in the maritime environment.\nKey maritime operations and antiâsubmarine warfare capabilities\nThe future submarine program is the largest defence procurement in Australiaâs history. A fleet of 12 new regionally superior submarines with a high degree of interoperability with the United States will replace the six current\nCollins\nClass submarines. The new submarines will provide an essential element of Australiaâs deterrent capability. The key roles of the future submarine will include: antiâsubmarine warfare; antiâsurface vessel warfare; intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance; and support to special operations. The results of the competitive evaluation process will be announced this year. The\nCollins\nClass submarine fleet will continue to be supported and upgraded to ensure that it remains a potent capability through the rest of its life and until transition to the new submarine.\nThe new submarines will likely begin to enter service in the early 2030s, with delivery extending over two decades to around 2050. A rolling acquisition program for Australiaâs future submarines will ensure that Australia is able to maintain a fleet of 12 regionally superior submarines as submarine and antiâsubmarine technologies develop over time. As part of a rolling acquisition program, a review of strategic circumstances and developments in submarine technology will be conducted in the late 2020s to consider whether the configuration of the submarines remains suitable or whether consideration of other specifications should commence. A rolling program of acquiring submarines will provide longâterm planning certainty for Australian industry, allowing companies to invest in the capabilities needed to support their involvement in the construction and sustainment activities.\nNine new antiâsubmarine warfare frigates will be introduced into service from the late 2020s, with construction to start in 2020, to replace the existing fleet of eight ANZAC Class frigates. The new frigates will have the range and endurance to operate throughout maritime South East Asia and be deployable from forward bases, such as in the Middle East. They will be equipped with offensive and selfâprotection systems.\nTwelve new offshore patrol vessels (OPV) will begin entering service from the early 2020s, with construction to start in 2018, replacing the 13\nArmidale\nClass patrol boats. The OPVs will have greater reach, endurance and capacity than the\nArmidale\nClass patrol boat fleet, allowing them to perform a broader range of border protection and patrol missions.\nAustraliaâs maritime surveillance and response capability will be significantly enhanced through the Governmentâs acquisition of seven additional Pâ8A Poseidon maritime surveillance and response aircraft to be acquired in two tranches for a total of 15 by the late 2020s. In addition to their sophisticated surveillance capabilities, these aircraft can undertake offensive operations against submarines and ships, as well as supporting search and rescue operations.\nTo improve our shipsâ situational awareness on operations, a new maritime tactical unmanned aircraft will also be delivered over the next decade. The tactical unmanned aircraft will be deployable on a range of Royal Australian Navy vessels including the OPVs and antiâsubmarine warfare frigates.\nAustraliaâs military hydrography capability provides sailors with precision measurement of the physical features of the oceans and water mass. The current fleet of two large and four smaller ADF hydrographic survey vessels will be progressively retired from around the early 2020s. Defence will replace this capability with an efficient combination of military and commercial hydrographic and oceanographic survey capabilities to deliver the required capacity.\nThree\nHobart\nClass Air Warfare Destroyers will be in service by the early 2020s. To ensure these vessels can keep pace with regional capabilities, upgrades will be made to the AEGIS combat system, weapons, selfâprotection and intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance systems throughout their service life. The vessels will provide Australian and coalition maritime task with defence against air and missile attack.\n24 MHâ60R Seahawk naval combat helicopters are currently being accepted into service. They will enhance the\nHobart\nClass Air Warfare Destroyersâ and\nANZAC\nClass Frigatesâ antiâship and antiâsubmarine warfare operations. A maritime fleet of up to eight MRHâ90 helicopters will support the amphibious and replenishment ship fleet.\nEnhancements to Defenceâs maritime capabilities will provide Australia with enhanced situational awareness of activities in our maritime domain, earlier detection of emerging threats to our border security and faster responses to deter and defeat any such threat.\nPeople\nAn additional around 800 ADF positions will be allocated to 2025â26 to support the substantially larger maritime force. The workforce will need to continue to grow beyond 2025â26, in particular to operate the larger fleet of submarines.\nInfrastructure\nWharf, and training and support facility upgrades to HMAS Stirling in Perth and Fleet Base East (Garden Island) in Sydney to 2025â26 will support our larger and more potent maritime capability. Infrastructure works at Cocos (Keeling) Islands, Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) Base Edinburgh, South Australia; and RAAF Base Tindal, Northern Territory, will ensure that these airfields can support the fleet of Pâ8A Poseidon aircraft. A range of training areas, testing ranges, and other Defence bases will be upgraded to 2025â26 to support our maritime capabilities, including recruitment facilities such as HMAS Cerberus in Victoria.\nDefence Service \u0026 Personnel Records\nFreedom of Information\nInformation Publication Scheme\nPopular publications\nAnnual reports\nBudget\nDefence White Paper\nFOI Disclosures\nInquiry Reports\nPay \u0026 Conditions Manual\nPublications\nIn focus\nPathway to Change\nFighting Fit - ADF Health Portal\nAnzac Centenary\nAnzac Day\nFirst Principles Review\nReport Abuse and Misconduct\nSeMPRO : Victim focused\nFamily and Domestic Violence\nLike the website?\nWe welcome you to take our 20 second survey and help us improve the site.\n \nFeedback\n \nMinister for Defence\nHome page\nBiography\nMedia releases\nSpeeches\nTranscripts\nDefence Service \u0026 Personnel Records\nFreedom of Information\nInformation Publication Scheme\nPopular publications\nAnnual reports\nBudget\nDefence White Paper\nFOI Disclosures\nInquiry Reports\nPay \u0026 Conditions Manual\nPublications\nIn focus\nPathway to Change\nFighting Fit - ADF Health Portal\nAnzac Centenary\nAnzac Day\nFirst Principles Review\nReport Abuse and Misconduct\nSeMPRO : Victim focused\nFamily and Domestic Violence\nLike the website?\nWe welcome you to take our 20 second survey and help us improve the site.\n \nFeedback\n \nMinister for Defence\nHome page\nBiography\nMedia releases\nSpeeches\nTranscripts\nDefending Australia and its National Interests\nContact us\nCopyright\nDisclaimer\nPrivacy\nAccessibility\nSitemap\nError/bug\nToggle responsive view\nBack to top\n","title":"   \t  Maritime Operations and Anti-Submarine Warfare : At a Glance       : Department of Defence","url":"http://defence.gov.au/Whitepaper/AtAGlance/Maritime-Ops.asp","version":1},"task":{"breadth":0,"created":"2018-09-27T21:43:55.534177015Z","depth":0,"host":"defence.gov.au","id":"bemku6ot87468b6omfbg","last_check":"2018-09-27T21:46:14.820275373Z","last_fetch":"2018-09-27T21:46:14.703867657Z","next_check":"2018-09-27T21:56:14.820275373Z","original_url":"http://defence.gov.au/Whitepaper/AtAGlance/Maritime-Ops.asp","reference_url":"http://defence.gov.au/WhitePaper/","schema":"http","snapshot_created":"2018-09-27T21:46:14.703847935Z","snapshot_hash":"56530c14738aca4d2fb8f707895eb5c0afa970c6","snapshot_id":"bemkv9gt8746bdj87oa0","snapshot_version":1,"status":3,"updated":"2018-09-27T21:46:14.683088144Z","url":"http://defence.gov.au/Whitepaper/AtAGlance/Maritime-Ops.asp"}},"fields":{"snapshot.title.keyword":["   \t  Maritime Operations and Anti-Submarine Warfare : At a Glance       : Department of Defence"]},"inner_hits":{"collpased_docs":{"hits":{"total":1,"max_score":1.3814803,"hits":[{"_index":"gopa-index","_type":"doc","_id":"a8eeff92a2a3638bd14c12743072772b","_score":1.3814803,"_source":{"host":"defence.gov.au","snapshot":{"content_type":"text/html","created":"2018-09-27T21:46:14.703847935Z","description":"\nAt a glance.

The Government will invest around 25 percent of Defence capital expenditure to 2025â26 in our maritime capabilities in the most comprehensive regeneration of our Navy since the Second World War. Our maritime forces will become more potent out to the 2030s through more capable submarines, ships and aircraft and better integration of combat and supporting systems across Defence. This will enable our forces to protect our maritime borders and resources, secure our immediate northern approaches and proximate sea lines of communication, and project force in the maritime environment.\nKey maritime operations and antiâsubmarine warfare capabilities\nThe future submarine program is the largest defence procurement in Australiaâs history. A fleet of 12 new regionally superior submarines with a high degree of interoperability with the United States will replace the six current\nCollins\nClass submarines. The new submarines will provide an essential element of Australiaâs deterrent capability. The key roles of the future submarine will include: antiâsubmarine warfare; antiâsurface vessel warfare; intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance; and support to special operations. The results of the competitive evaluation process will be announced this year. The\nCollins\nClass submarine fleet will continue to be supported and upgraded to ensure that it remains a potent capability through the rest of its life and until transition to the new submarine.\nThe new submarines will likely begin to enter service in the early 2030s, with delivery extending over two decades to around 2050. A rolling acquisition program for Australiaâs future submarines will ensure that Australia is able to maintain a fleet of 12 regionally superior submarines as submarine and antiâsubmarine technologies develop over time. As part of a rolling acquisition program, a review of strategic circumstances and developments in submarine technology will be conducted in the late 2020s to consider whether the configuration of the submarines remains suitable or whether consideration of other specifications should commence. A rolling program of acquiring submarines will provide longâterm planning certainty for Australian industry, allowing companies to invest in the capabilities needed to support their involvement in the construction and sustainment activities.\nNine new antiâsubmarine warfare frigates will be introduced into service from the late 2020s, with construction to start in 2020, to replace the existing fleet of eight ANZAC Class frigates. The new frigates will have the range and endurance to operate throughout maritime South East Asia and be deployable from forward bases, such as in the Middle East. They will be equipped with offensive and selfâprotection systems.\nTwelve new offshore patrol vessels (OPV) will begin entering service from the early 2020s, with construction to start in 2018, replacing the 13\nArmidale\nClass patrol boats. The OPVs will have greater reach, endurance and capacity than the\nArmidale\nClass patrol boat fleet, allowing them to perform a broader range of border protection and patrol missions.\nAustraliaâs maritime surveillance and response capability will be significantly enhanced through the Governmentâs acquisition of seven additional Pâ8A Poseidon maritime surveillance and response aircraft to be acquired in two tranches for a total of 15 by the late 2020s.

This force will be achieved through the\nGovernmentâs funding plan, which raises Defence funding to two per cent of Gross Domestic\nProduction by 2020â21. The Defence budget will rise from $32.4 billion in 2016â17 to $58.7 billion in\n2025â26, with approximately $195 billion to be invested in Defence capability over this period.\nMaritime Operations and AntiâSubmarine Warfare\nThe Government will invest around 25 per cent of Defence capability expenditure to 2025â26 in our\nmaritime operations and antiâsubmarine warfare capabilities as part of a significant regeneration of\nour maritime capabilities. Key capabilities will include: 12 new regionally superior submarines; nine\nnew antiâsubmarine warfare frigates; 12 new offshore patrol vessels; seven additional Pâ8A Poseidon\nmaritime surveillance and response aircraft for a total of 15 aircraft by the late 2020s (which will\ncomplement the seven MQâ4C Triton unmanned surveillance aircraft); new maritime tactical\nunmanned aircraft to improve our shipsâ situational awareness on operations; modernised mine\ncountermeasures and hydrographicârelated capabilities; and a new deployable landâbased antiâship\nmissile capability.\nIntelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance, Space, Electronic Warfare and\nCyber Security\nThe Government will invest around nine per cent of Defence capability expenditure to 2025â26 in\nstrengthening our intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance, electronic warfare, space, and cyber\ncapabilities so that our forces have a comprehensive awareness of what is happening around them\nand the ability to respond. Key capabilities will include: enhanced intelligence collection and analysis,\nincluding in support of targeting; enhancements to broad area surveillance through the acquisition\nof the MQâ4C Triton unmanned surveillance aircraft and enhancements to the Jindalee Operational\nRadar Network; strengthened electronic warfare support to naval, air and land forces, including\nthrough the 12 E/Aâ18G Growler electronic attack aircraft and a new long range electronic warfare\nsupport capability based on the Gulfstream G550 airframe, with additional modified systems;\nenhanced space situational awareness; and enhanced cyber capabilities to deter and defend against\nthe threat of cyber attack.\nKey Enablers\nThe Government will invest around 25 per cent of Defence capability expenditure to 2025â26 in the\nenablers that are essential to the operation and sustainment of the ADF. Even the most capable\nplatforms and systems will not be effective without the enabling capabilities that allow those\nplatforms to operate. Key enabling capabilities to receive substantial investment over the next\ndecade include: our people; critical infrastructure such as bases, training ranges, wharves and\nairfields; information and communications technology; simulators; logistics; science and technology;\nhealth services; and strengthening force design, strategic and international policy.\nAir and Sea Lift\nThe Government will invest around six per cent of Defence capability expenditure to 2025â26 in air\nand sea lift capabilities. The long distances over which the ADF is required to operate means flexible\nand high endurance air and sea lift capabilities are essential to lift, move, and sustain the ADF.\nKey capabilities will include: two additional heavyâlift Câ17A Globemaster III transport aircraft\nalready acquired to complement the existing six Câ17A fleet (with consideration of further additional\nheavy lift aircraft at a later stage); two additional KCâ30A airâtoâair refuellers for a total of seven\naircraft (expanding the fleet to nine aircraft will be considered in the longer term); three additional\nCHâ47F Chinook heavyâlift helicopters to complement previously planned CHâ47F Chinook heavyâlift\nhelicopters for a fleet of 10 aircraft, extension and upgrades for the logistics support ship,\nHMAS Choules; two new replenishment ships by 2026 to resupply naval forces with the option for a\nthird replenishment or additional logistics ship in the late 2020s; and a large hulled multiâpurpose\npatrol vessel for the Navy to support border protection and maritime resource security related tasks.\nStrike and Air Combat\nThe Government will invest around 17 per cent of Defence capability expenditure to 2025â26 in our\nstrike and air combat capabilities. More potent strike capabilities will provide flexibility for the ADF\nto rapidly respond to threats against Australia and provide military contributions to support regional\nsecurity and coalition operations globally where our interests are engaged. Key capabilities will\ninclude: 72 Fâ35A Lightning II Joint Strike Fighters to enter service from 2020 to replace the current\nfleet of 71 F/Aâ18A/B Classic Hornets; 12 EAâ18G Growler electronic attack aircraft to enter service\nfrom 2018; new airâtoâsurface, airâtoâair and highâspeed and longârange strike and antiâship\nweapons; and strengthened command and control, integrated air and missile defence, and\nsituational awareness capabilities to support strike and air combat operations.\nLand Combat and Amphibious Warfare\nThe Government will invest around 18 per cent of Defence capability expenditure to 2025â26 in our\nland combat and amphibious warfare capabilities to provide greater mobility, firepower, protection\nand situational awareness. Key capabilities will include: a new program for continuous upgrade of\npersonal equipment and force protection for our soldiers; new combat reconnaissance, infantry\nfighting, and protected mobility vehicles; upgrades to the M1 Abrams Main Battle Tanks; new armed\nintelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance unmanned aircraft; a new longârange rocket system to\ncomplement existing artillery; logistics enablers to support the amphibious deployment capability of\nthe two Canberra Class ships; and a new fleet of lightly armed boats for operations in a wide range\nof estuarine environments. Investments in Special Forces will deliver: a fleet of light reconnaissance\nand attack helicopters, highâend close combat capabilities, tactical mobility, situational awareness,\ndigital communications, force protection, target awareness and logistic support.\nDefence Service \u0026 Personnel Records\nFreedom of Information\nInformation Publication Scheme\nPopular publications\nAnnual reports\nBudget\nDefence White Paper\nFOI Disclosures\nInquiry Reports\nPay \u0026 Conditions Manual\nPublications\nIn focus\nPathway to Change\nFighting Fit - ADF Health Portal\nAnzac Centenary\nAnzac Day\nFirst Principles Review\nReport Abuse and Misconduct\nSeMPRO : Victim focused\nFamily and Domestic Violence\nLike the website?\nWe welcome you to take our 20 second survey and help us improve the site.\n \nFeedback\n \nMinister for Defence\nHome page\nBiography\nMedia releases\nSpeeches\nTranscripts\nDefence Service \u0026 Personnel Records\nFreedom of Information\nInformation Publication Scheme\nPopular publications\nAnnual reports\nBudget\nDefence White Paper\nFOI Disclosures\nInquiry Reports\nPay \u0026 Conditions Manual\nPublications\nIn focus\nPathway to Change\nFighting Fit - ADF Health Portal\nAnzac Centenary\nAnzac Day\nFirst Principles Review\nReport Abuse and Misconduct\nSeMPRO : Victim focused\nFamily and Domestic Violence\nLike the website?\nWe welcome you to take our 20 second survey and help us improve the site.\n \nFeedback\n \nMinister for Defence\nHome page\nBiography\nMedia releases\nSpeeches\nTranscripts\nDefending Australia and its National Interests\nContact us\nCopyright\nDisclaimer\nPrivacy\nAccessibility\nSitemap\nError/bug\nToggle responsive view\nBack to top\n","title":"   \t  Capability Overview : At a Glance       : Department of Defence","url":"http://defence.gov.au/Whitepaper/AtAGlance/Capability-Overview.asp","version":1},"task":{"breadth":0,"created":"2018-09-27T21:43:55.534472907Z","depth":0,"host":"defence.gov.au","id":"bemku6ot87468b6omfcg","last_check":"2018-09-27T21:46:15.040334964Z","last_fetch":"2018-09-27T21:46:14.81954567Z","next_check":"2018-09-27T21:56:15.040334964Z","original_url":"http://defence.gov.au/Whitepaper/AtAGlance/Capability-Overview.asp","reference_url":"http://defence.gov.au/WhitePaper/","schema":"http","snapshot_created":"2018-09-27T21:46:14.819521141Z","snapshot_hash":"80ca83a287c8463c6cbcdc69d30afd872c30d2d0","snapshot_id":"bemkv9gt8746bdj87osg","snapshot_version":1,"status":3,"updated":"2018-09-27T21:46:14.714745588Z","url":"http://defence.gov.au/Whitepaper/AtAGlance/Capability-Overview.asp"}},"fields":{"snapshot.title.keyword":["   \t  Capability Overview : At a Glance       : Department of Defence"]},"inner_hits":{"collpased_docs":{"hits":{"total":1,"max_score":1.3814803,"hits":[{"_index":"gopa-index","_type":"doc","_id":"0a8a3cd56f945ebdafdd7043976c9df9","_score":1.3814803,"_source":{"host":"defence.gov.au","snapshot":{"content_type":"text/html","created":"2018-09-27T21:46:14.819521141Z","description":"\nAt a glance.
